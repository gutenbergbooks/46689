<h2><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>I have to thank very cordially my friend, Monsieur Fran&ccedil;ois Fertiault,
for his kindness in permitting me to make use of the valuable material
comprised in his charming books upon rural Burgundy; and I have also to
thank M. A. de Charmasse and his publisher, M. Dejussieu, of Autun, for
placing at my disposal the information contained in that author's Pr&eacute;cis
Historique to "Autun et ses Monuments" and in the archeological portion
of the same work, written by the late M. H. de Fontenay, a book which I
recommend to those who wish to study fully the stones of that interesting
city.</p>

<p>I have also to acknowledge the kindness of Mm. Mame &amp; Fils, of Tours,
in granting permission to translate the Burgundian legends, "Le Creux du
Diable," "Le Puits de St. Martin," and "L'Abbaye de St<sup>e.</sup> Marguerite," by
the late Abb&eacute; B&mdash;&mdash;, published by that house: also the courtesy of M.
Gabriel Hanotaux, of the French Academy, and of his publishers, Messrs.
Hachette, of Paris, in permitting the reproduction of a portrait of Philippe
le Bon (p. 191) from his recent work on Jeanne d'Arc. My thanks are due,
too, to M. Perrault-Dabot, who kindly allows me to make use of the engraving
of Cluny (p. 72) from his work "L'Art en Bourgogne."</p>

<p>If the support given to this volume on South Burgundy justifies me in
doing so, I hope, before very long, to follow it by a second, dealing with the
northern part of the duchy.</p>

<p>Among the works consulted in writing this book are the following:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>Although the history of Burgundy is intimately connected with that of
England&mdash;the policy of the Valois Dukes, for example, affected profoundly
our national destinies during the hundred years' war&mdash;the average English
reader's knowledge of the subject is contained within the four corners of a
wine list. He knows Beaune&mdash;knows the name well, as that of a drinkable
brand, may have blessed it in his heart, when a ray from the shaded lamp shot
through its ruby depths. If by any chance he loves Meredith, he may,
even, under its kindly influence, have whispered to his fair partner, Dr.
Middleton's phrase: "Burgundy has great genius; Burgundy sings the inspired
ode." But should his lady slip in a question concerning this ruddy
heartener of man, he could not answer; he would stumble between the C&ocirc;te
d'Azur and the C&ocirc;te d'Or.</p>

<p>Not another town of Burgundy could he name. Dijon he knows, and
remembers; because there he scalded his throat with hot coffee, gulped down,
at three in the morning, on the way home from the Riviera; or, bound for
Switzerland, he may have passed through the town. But he does not know
Dijon as a Burgundian Capital, nor as a proud city of royal palaces and
unrivalled sculpture. At most, when he hears the duchy named, there
floats through his mind a shadowy memory of Henry V., or of King Lear.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Yet Burgundy was the scene of events vital in the making of Europe. It
was one of the strongholds of Roman civilization. It saw the genesis of a
religious movement that was the greatest feature of eleventh and twelfth
century history. Cluny was a nursery of popes; Citeaux became a breeding ground
of saints; their abbots lorded it over mighty kings; they dictated to
potentates and princes; they bent all western Europe beneath their sway.
Bernard's eloquence fired three nations with enthusiasm for the second
crusade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>That Power, when it had passed from the great monastic houses, fell
later, in a modified form, to the Valois Dukes. Safely housed in Dijon, or
in Bruges, ruling a people sheltered, to some extent, from the appalling
disasters that were transforming the fair kingdom of France into a howling
wilderness, they kept a more than royal state. Gathering about their
persons a great company of distinguished artists and valiant knights, they
established a school of sculpture unmatched in their time; they held pageants
and tournaments the most brilliant that chivalry had ever seen.</p>

<p>Headstrong and ambitious, they challenged the crown of France, and
defied it; they dreamed dreams of a Burgundian empire extending eastward
beyond the Alps and northward to the Channel.</p>

<p>'Tis true that these ambitions were never sated. The house of Valois
had not the constructive mind of which empire is begotten: moreover,
Destiny, and Louis XI., were too strong for them. But the glorious tale
of ducal efforts towards that goal outshines all other sunset splendours of
dying medi&aelig;valism.</p>

<p>When I think of what might be made of such a theme, I could tear these
pages, because my best is not better.</p>

<p>Yet history does not end the attractions of Burgundy. It only begins
them. Nature, too, has her pageant "in this best garden of the world,"
she will hold you here, whether you choose the delicious, poplar-fringed
plains of the Sa&ocirc;ne, the "waterish" Burgundy that the French king sneers
at in "Lear"&mdash;he would have gloried in the land had it been his own&mdash;or
the stern and silent hills of the Jura and the Morvan; or the vine-clad
slopes of sunny C&ocirc;te d'Or.</p>

<p>But, best of all, this land and its people have a character wholly their own.
You will not feel here the twilight melancholy of Celtic Brittany; the
quivering, electric atmosphere of romantic Provence; nor the passionate
intensity of dark Languedoc; but you will find a country well typified by
its wines, its sculpture, its architecture&mdash;a solid, ample, full-bodied, full-blooded
land; a people strong and vivacious, concealing, beneath a somewhat
harsh and stern exterior, a cheerful heart and an abundant generosity; comfortable,
courageous, eloquent, sonorous folk, that love a good dinner, and
a good story to follow, that have produced a Bernard, a Bossuet, and a
Lamartine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The key to this Burgundian character, with its blend of Gallic, Latin,
and German elements, the key to Burgundian history, too, is the geographical
position of the country. Its great water-ways flow northward, by the
Yonne, to the English Channel, and southward, by the Sa&ocirc;ne, to the
Mediterranean and the traffic of the East; along its valleys run the great
trading roads and railways connecting northern and southern, eastern and
western Europe. With the exception of the Jura, no natural barriers exist
between Burgundy and the adjoining lands. It was open at all quarters;
from every point of the compass it borrowed, and it lent. Michelet's
visionary thought has summed up, in a splendid phrase, the secret of
Burgundy. He says, speaking of the country round Dijon: "La France
n'a pas d'&eacute;l&eacute;ment plus liant, plus capable de r&eacute;concilier le nord et le midi."</p>

<p>There you have it. To reconcile the bitter antagonisms of north and
south, and, in a lesser degree, of east and west, was Burgundy's destiny;
the geographical position that enabled her to do so was at once the source of
her greatness, and the cause of her fall. While she remained independent,
unity was impossible for France; and England's peace was imperilled by
irresistible temptations to attack a weakened neighbour.</p>

<p>In writing this book, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to preserve
historical continuity. That must be my excuse for geographical flights
which, else, might bewilder my readers.</p>

<p class="pmb3">My hope is that these pages may awaken, here and there, lasting interest
in a land that, whether for varied scenery, sunny climate, good living,
characteristic architecture, or, above all, historical associations of the first
importance, can hold its own with any other ancient province of France.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p class="p2">We had expected quiet, rural times in this far-away village of St.-L&eacute;ger-sous-Beuvray;
but I doubt whether we shall get them. The village green
in front of the Hotel du Morvan shows signs of unusual animation; it is
dotted with carts, which are discharging tent-poles, canvas, golden cars, and
other paraphernalia of a country festival; and, surer sign still, through the
door of an open shed, I can see hanging, headless and lamentable, the
gaping corpse of a fatted calf. Yes! there is his tawny countenance and
two mild eyes looking down, like those of a martyred saint, from the cruel
hook. The odour of him, wafted in succulent puffs, from the dead-house
door, has cheered with a splendid hope half the dogs in the village, and
awakened from torpor two ancient hounds, who prowl, almost youthfully,
sniffing fragrant memories in the air.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen?" I asked the landlord, who was sharpening
tools on a bench.</p>

<p>"'Tis the Lou&eacute;e, Monsieur, the hiring that takes place every year. All
in the neighbourhood who want farm-hands, or domestic servants, and those
who want places, come to-morrow morning and make bargains. And the
Directeur of Enfants Assist&eacute;s (Foundlings) is coming, too; he is to stop
here at my hotel, and so his children get work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>We were up early the next morning. Only deaf men, or dead ones,
sleep through a Lou&eacute;e. There came to us in our bedroom, with the sunshine,
an indescribable babel of sounds&mdash;babble of voices, braying of trumpets,
banging of drums. To a Londoner, strange methods of doing
business!</p>

<p>We went out into the din and the sunshine to find the transformation
complete. All the green was dotted with booths bright with gaudy trinkets
of every imaginable colour; shooting galleries, and a hundred other sou-trapping
devices. Before every inn had sprung up, as if by magic, a salle de
bal, with a real wooden floor, and a little balcony for the musicians. There
was a gipsy encampment, too, where, heedless of the din, a Romany sat
upon the trunk of a fallen tree, methodically skinning hedgehogs with a
knife; while his two small sons were unmethodically currey-combing the
yellow pony, and dusting him down with his own tail, cut off and tied to a
stick! The door of the caravan opened; there was a glimpse of a woman's
arm, and a pailful of slops shot out, sparkling in the sun, to alight
where fate might decree. Brown drops splashed up into the hollow
eyes of Grandmother, dreaming on a chair by the steps. Meanwhile
the peasants went on hiring and being hired; some sealing
the bargain with a glass of red wine, in the Caf&eacute;; some, if
the maid were comely, with a kiss. Peasants I call them, though,
at first sight, this array of black blouses and black squash hats suggests a
meeting of nonconformist parsons, rather than farmers of the Morvan. Yet
one learns to accept them so, and to enjoy the deep, black shadows that lurk
in the folds of the garments. Straw hats are few; but the white caps of
the old ladies are there for contrast.</p>

<p>Wearied of the buzzing crowd, the nerve-racking crack of the rifles, we
wandered out of the village, and sat by the edge of a ploughed field, where
we watched, above a rampart of firs shot with spring greens, the purple mass
of dark Beuvray lifting its crested summit into the cloudless sky,&mdash;mysterious
Beuvray, whence of old, as darkness closed upon their homes,
the wondering peasants in the valley, heard, from the mysterious mountain
city above their heads, the sound of great gates creaking harshly upon their
hinges.</p>

<p>But to-morrow is for Beuvray. To-day we will watch the long
stream of peasants coming to the Fair, by the lanes that wind, up and down,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
among the buttress hills of the mount. They come on foot, in farm carts,
on bicycles; but most of them come in little, trim donkey-carts; husband
and wife sitting primly side by side, their tanned faces shewing strongly
above the silently twitching, brown ears of the "baudet." Here is a family
in a donkey-drawn washing-basket, three generations of them, packed like
sardines. After d&eacute;jeuner, when the hiring is done, the older ones leave;
the turn of the younger is come. Then the fillettes begin to appear&mdash;Fifines
made fine for the Fair&mdash;all cut after the same pattern, with white
blouses below much be-ribboned straw hats; each carrying, because of the
mid-day sun, a grey jacket lined with light blue. These come tripping
from village and hamlet, clinging to each other, with little toddlers holding
their hands; all chattering, smiling, sweltering, happy. The fiddlers will
be tuning up in the Salles de Bal.</p>

<p>So we followed the maids back to the village, and wandered again among
the booths. An old, old lady, beside a not less ancient friend was nursing a
tin mug. They were discussing bargains and their budget. "I got this for
three sous; et je trouve que c'est bien solide." On that point she was cruelly
deceived. But what matter? Thinking makes it so. What a popping of
corks comes from the Caf&eacute;!</p>

<p>Bang! Bang!! Bang!! Bang!! Bang!!! The crowd surges toward
a compelling din. Before the largest of the tents a half-naked, muscular
ruffian stands silent upon a tub; beside him another, clad in shiny velveteens,
shouts himself hoarse.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you all know that the 'lutte est le premier gymnastique du
monde.' Come in then, and see. Our professor challenges all comers. He
will wrestle with a great bear. Now for la lutte aux ours! Entrez; we
will show you the v&eacute;ritable gorille, and the most terrible beast in the world,
the Monstre du Pole Nord." And, indeed, above his head was writ in gold
letters, the fearsome legend: "<span class="smcap">Monstre du Pole Nord.</span>"</p>

<p>We went in, with other youths and maidens. The baby that followed
us, shewing signs of strong emotion, was hastily removed by its mother.</p>

<p>"Up against the canvas, please gentlemen. La s&eacute;ance va commencer au
milieu!"</p>

<p>We watched while, before the bars that held the four-legged animals, the
naked bipeds struggled furiously; clutching, writhing, rolling, till the bare,
oily skins were dark with perspiration and sawdust. Their eyes were so full
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of it, that, between the rounds, they were gouging it out with their knuckles.
"Ca y est! Ca y est!" "At it again!"</p>

<p>"Bravo monsieur l'amateur, un petit bravo pour l'amateur"&mdash;with arms
like telegraph posts&mdash;"le plus fort du pays." So it went on&mdash;the "lutte
aux hommes," the "lutte aux ours."</p>

<p>For a full five minutes the sanded professor leant up against and pushed
the furry mass of Jean Pierre, the feebly scratching, tangled bear, who was
too bored to be m&eacute;chant. From behind their bars the Monstre Du Pole
Nord (a sloth bear) and "le v&eacute;ritable gorille" (a Barbary ape) grunted
approval of their companion's efforts.</p>

<p>Through the crowded entrance we pushed our way into the largest of the
Salles de Bal, bright with lit lamps and coloured ribbons. In a scarlet
and green box, with a yellow diamond, slung to the roof of the tent, the
fiddlers and viol players, sitting in their shirt-sleeves, squeaked and ground
lustily. There was babble of voices and rhythmic scuffle of feet. A young
soldier, fair and close-cropped, in uniform, crossed the salle, bowed to my
wife, and asked for a dance. A moment's hesitation, and she was whirling
round with the others. As he said to her at parting; "You are not in
France every day." It was three in the morning before darkness and silence
settled down upon St.-L&eacute;ger-sous-Beuvray.</p>

<p>The next morning we rode to the Mount by a lane that, undulating,
climbs, through pasture, arable, and woodland, among the buttress hills of
Beuvray, to the Poirier aux Chiens, a lonely farmhouse, where we left our
bicycles. Cyclists are rather worried hereabout by excitable dogs and
hysterical sheep; but the former are not dangerous, as they are in
Languedoc and other parts of the south of France; and we are happily free
to-day from the dangers of two hundred years ago; as when, on the 18th of
June, 1718, at nightfall, St. L&eacute;ger was visited by a mad wolf from the top
of Beuvray, that wounded and disfigured sixteen people, of whom all but
one died of hydrophobia. The single exception was a woman, who had
only been scratched by the animal's claws. After this incident a Confraternity
of St. Hubert was established in connection with the Church, and
by the authority of the bishop, for the destruction of wild beasts.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The easiest path by which those who are not familiar with the locality
can climb Beuvray, is from the Croix du Rebout, nearly two kilometres
beyond the Poirier aux Chiens, at the top of the col, just where the descent
begins. Several other paths lead up to it; but as there are more than
twenty miles of Gaulish roads intersecting on the tree-clad slopes of the
Mount, it is very easy to lose yourself completely, as I did on my first visit;
until there was nothing for it but to descend to the road and seek another
path. My only consolation for those two hours of wasted energy was that,
while lunching beside the forest path, I met, face to face, a red fox ambling
jauntily on his way. How we stared at one another; and how I wished
that, for once, he could talk.</p>

<p>But, "after all," the reader may ask, "Why climb Beuvray? When
you are up there, what is to be seen but a view; and what mean these
twenty miles of Gaulish roads through a wilderness of boughs?" To which
pertinent question I reply, that in all France there is but one Beuvray.</p>

<p>You will find more romantic peaks in the Alpines of Provence, you will
find grander, more striking mountains in volcanic Auvergne; in the Alps
you will see summits, clothed in eternal snow, beside which the Mount is
but a molehill; but nowhere will you find such a hill as this, whose flanks
have echoed to the tramp of C&aelig;sar's legions, whose crest, the council
chamber of kings and generals, has flamed through long nights with the
beacon fires of a great city. Nowhere else will you find a hill that the
centuries have so peopled with dragon and saint, with phantom hound and
spectre horseman, and have made as harmonious with legendary poetry and
immemorial voices, as nature has made her woods vocal with whispering fern
and wandering wind, with the ripple of the brook, and the stir of creeping
things in the grass.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>For this Beuvray is no other than Bibracte, the Gaulish oppidum that
C&aelig;sar speaks of as "Oppido Aeduorum longe maximo et copiosissimo."<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Tradition, as I have said, had rumoured it for centuries as the site of an
ancient city; but many had supposed that Autun was the place referred to,
until the researches of M. Bulliot, the Antiquary of Hamerton's delightful
work "The Mount," settled the problem once for all. Of the history of
the last days of the town I will say something in the next chapter; for the
present, let us be content to mount the rocky, rain-washed, Gaulish road that
leads up, through interlacing boughs, to the "Grand Hotel des Gaulois," or,
in other words, the little house and sheds near the summit, which the
antiquary occupied while making his researches and excavations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The
path runs beside many of the most interesting discoveries, though nothing
of the remains is to be seen, the owner having stipulated that all "fouilles"
should be covered up, a precaution necessary in any event, if the primitive
Gaulish homes of stones and wood, with mud for mortar, are ever to be
preserved to a later posterity.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>After passing the huts, you come, by a grassy woodland path winding up
through ferns and bracken, to the terrace on the summit of the hill, now
mercifully clear of the ubiquitous trees. Here, on the site of the ancient
temple to the Dea Bibracte, one of the many Gaulish gods, M. Bulliot has
erected a little chapel in Romanesque style, dedicated to St. Martin. Here,
also, is a granite cross, with a carving of St. Martin performing an act of
charity at the gate of Amiens; not far away is a memorial to M. Bulliot
himself.</p>

<p>Tradition has given much prominence to the doings of St. Martin here,
as elsewhere in France, and it seems probable that the saint did visit
Bibracte, about the year 377, on his way to Autun. M. Bulliot, and
other authorities, agree that he preached on the plateau of Beuvray, possibly
from the Pierre de la Wivre; and the legend has it that here he overthrew
a pagan temple, arousing thereby such fierce anger among the inhabitants,
that he escaped only by a miraculous leap of his ass across the gorge of
Malvaux (Mauvaise vall&eacute;e) to the south-west of the Mount, where the
animal's hoof-prints are still to be seen. Later I shall give fully a precisely
similar legend concerning St. Martin in the valley of Nantoux.</p>

<p class="pmb2">When once we had got our bearings, and accustomed ourselves to the
silence and solitude of the spot, we began to feel the charm of the lonely
plateau, and to realize its attractions for those who would live close to nature
and to the past. When I first visited it, on a bright autumn afternoon, not a
leaf was astir upon the golden oaks, not a spray of the bramble trembled,
not a rustle was heard among the dead ferns in the grass; only, from far
away in the valley below, came the rumble of a cart-wheel, the crack of
a sportsman's rifle in the distant woods.</p>

<span class="i0">The sigh of all the sleepers in the world;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the rivers running to the sea."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I looked down through the fringing trees. For mile after mile the
country lay golden before me, fields rising and falling, till they were lost
in the eastern sky. There was little St. L&eacute;ger, a toy village among tiny
hills; there was the Etang de Poisson, a sapphire set in emeralds, and far away
the evening sun flashing upon the spires of Autun Cathedral.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
sound of a footstep broke the stillness. A youth was approaching me&mdash;a
ch&eacute;tif, mis-shapen, shaking thing. He gazed on me with drooping jaw,
and passed muttering&mdash;an idiot wandering through a night-mare world.</p>

<p>Then I, too, began to dream fantastic dreams, and to see spectres of the
past, such as&mdash;the peasants tell you&mdash;still flit over the crest of Beuvray,&mdash;a
white horse galloping at midnight, a loud voice commanding ghostly
legions in Latin; shadowy riders, moving shades of medi&aelig;val knights and
barons still climbing the stony paths to this their airy tilting ground.
Winged gabble raches passed screaming over my head, and, from afar,
baying in deep-mouthed thunder, I heard the hounds of the phantom hunter
of Touleur.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But that was a thundery day last autumn, and this is a soft April
evening, with a breeze in the leaves, and silver clouds afloat in a blue sky.
Moreover, I am not alone.</p>

<p>We wandered back by the path along which we had come, and made our
way to the Pierre de la Wivre, a curious, pointed rock rising from the
plateau. Its sulphurous yellow colour is due to the lichen with which it is
covered. From the green headland, surrounded with holly-bushes, on which
it stands, you have magnificent views over rounded, village-dotted hills,
whose brown-green upland fields nestle up to the dark forests that crown
every summit. Up from the valleys come the shouts of the teamsters
urging on the slow, pale oxen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>This Pierre de la Wivre shows signs of man's handling, and has probably
been the scene of human sacrifices, and of other ancient religious rites. We
asked ourselves whether there may not have been some religious significance
in the surrounding belt of holly bushes, since there are indications of a
similar belt round the chapel of St. Martin. Perhaps the holly tree was
sacred to the Gauls. Sitting upon the stone we recalled the legend as
told by Hamerton.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"The peasants believe that the Wivern dwells near it in a hidden
cavern guarding its treasure, but that once a year the cavern opens and the
Wivern goes out, leaving the treasure unguarded. As to the time of year
when this happens the narrators differ. Some say that it is at midnight on
Christmas Eve, others fix it for Easter Day during High Mass; in either
case it is during Mass, as there is a midnight service at Christmas. The
popular legend in its present form goes on to recount how a certain woman,
accompanied by her child, went to the stone of the Wivern, instead of going
to Mass, intending to take his treasure. She found the cave open, entered,
and took as much gold as she could carry, and came out just in time to
escape the Wivern on his return. On looking round for her child, she
could not find him anywhere. The cavern being now closed again, she
knew not what to do, and went in despair to the priest, who told her to go
to the place every day and pour milk and honey on the stone till the expiration
of twelve months, and then, when the day came for the opening of the
cave, to take her treasure back to it undiminished, and she would find her
child. So she went day by day without fail, in heat and cold, in fine
weather and foul, and poured milk and honey on the stone. At last the
day came when the Wivern left the cave, and the mother found her child
within, sitting quite unhurt, and in perfect health, with an apple before him
on a stone table. So she restored the treasure gladly, and took away her
child."</p>

<p>M. Bulliot thinks that the legend was originally one of some Gaulish
sacrilege and reparatory oblation, the Gaulish priests requiring a daily offering
(perhaps of milk and honey) until certain stolen treasure was restored.
The Catholic character of the legend he looks upon as nothing but an
aftergrowth; and the apple has, in his opinion, a distinct though undiscoverable
significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Pierre de la Wivre we could see, on the next headland to our
left, the ridge of Pierre Salv&eacute;e sharply serrated against the sky. There,
half an hour later, we found ourselves rewarded by a glorious sight. Westward
we could see extending mile upon mile, ridge after ridge, the glowing
mountains of Auvergne, and the valley of the Loire, veiled in a shimmering
mist, through whose mysterious wreaths flashed, here and there, in diamond
splendour, the sun-touched roof of a humble cottage and the tower of a
lordly chateau.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>With all the thousand other interesting details concerning Bibracte&mdash;the
Gaulish roads, the ramparts, the remains, the descriptions and industries of
the town, the visits of C&aelig;sar&mdash;I have no space to deal here; but I
recommend particularly to the reader Hamerton's book, from which I have
quoted, and M. Dechelette's handy guide, "L'Oppidum de Bibracte."</p>

<p>We cycled from St. L&eacute;ger to Autun, by way of La Grand Verri&egrave;re
Monthelon, and the Valley of the Arroux. Monthelon, some seven kilometres
from Autun, is a place famous in French Ecclesiastical history. It
has, as is common in Burgundian villages, a delightful little Romanesque
Church, concerning one of whose cur&eacute;s Hamerton tells a good story which
I cannot refrain from giving in the original tongue.</p>

<p>This old cur&eacute;, then, was fond of putting Latin into his sermons, a little
bit at a time, his own Latin; not of the best. "'Lorsque je para&icirc;trai devant
Notre Seigneur, il me demandera; 'Cur&eacute; Monthelonius, ubi sunt brebetis
meis'&mdash;ce qui veut dire; 'Cur&eacute; de Monthelon, o&ugrave; sont me brebis?' Et
moi je lui r&eacute;pondrai; 'b&ecirc;tes je les ai trouv&eacute;es, b&ecirc;tes je les ai laiss&eacute;es, et
b&ecirc;tes elles sont tr&egrave;s probablement encore.'"</p>

<p class="pmb2">Can you refrain from reading "The Mount" after that?</p>

<p class="p2">In the railway station of Autun we had waited long for our bicycles to
be taken out of the train. They did not appear. The porters were all
busy with a cattle-truck that they were pushing casually down a siding, till
it was stopped in mid-career by the buffers of another truck.</p>

<p>Bang!! Rattle! Bang!! The thicket of horns, visible from without,
shook like a wood in a winter gale. A mild white head was thrust over
the lime-washed barrier, mutely protesting. We echo the animal's protest,
and our own.</p>

<p>"Do you always keep travellers waiting like this?"</p>

<p>"You see, Monsieur, it is because of the cow, she is bien souffrante."</p>

<p>"Then why treat her so?" I pointed to the still trembling truck; "but
in any case, are we of less importance than a cow? Are not we, too, bien
souffrant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you see, Monsieur, if the cow died, the <i>patron</i> would lose four
hundred francs; but, had I known, I would have brought your bicycles
earlier." We reached the Hotel St. Louis at last.</p>

<p>Then, wishing to escape, until dinner-time, from the still glowing
streets, we crossed the Place du Champs de Mars, followed the gentle
descent of the Faubourg d'Arroux, and passed beneath the Roman gate that
leads northward from the city of Augustus into the open plain. A hundred
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
yards or so further on, a sharp turn to the left brought us to two bridges
crossing the tributary streams that wind among the whispering poplars,
beneath which, all day long, the kneeling blanchisseuses have been pounding
mercilessly their unoffending washing. Continuing our walk between
the dusty green hedges of the lane meandering through the fertile plain of
Autun, we saw, rising before us, a building whose mysterious, alluring aspect
at once rivetted our attention, as it must that of all who have an eye for the
spirit of the past, and an ear for her call. We entered boldly by the gate
in the hedge, and shared possession of the field with the pale cows, who,
placid as the stones, and not unlike them in colour, lifted to us questioning
eyes.</p>

<p>The monument,&mdash;all that remains of it, rather,&mdash;consists of two great
stone walls, adjacent sides of a building, ruined and roofless. It rises in
the midst of the meadow, from among the grasses and brambles about its
base, a huge, weird, Caliban-like thing, shattered, yet still massive, pierced
with great tortured openings, and many smaller ones above. The golden
light of evening, gilding it, casts into the holes and crevices, between the
weather-worn masonry, pitchy shadows from which the stones bristle out
defiantly, as though challenging the centuries to undo them, if man will
but hold his hand.</p>

<p>This relic of Roman times, called by the peasants, "The Temple of
Janus"&mdash;though some antiquarians deny that it was ever a temple, and that
the three headed god was ever worshipped there&mdash;is not the only striking
object in the landscape. Away to the north-west, behind the tossing boughs
of the poplars, the setting sun is adorning with changing purples the flanks
of the distant hills. The broadest of those peaks, crested with dark
foliage, is none other than our old friend the Mount.</p>

<p>We turned to the opposite side of the valley. Before us were symbols of
two later periods of Burgundy's prosperity&mdash;the modern city of Autun,
seated proudly upon the lower slopes of a mountain throne, and, high above
the roofs, the great mass of the cathedral of St. Lazare lifting her Gothic
spire to the sky.</p>

<p>The peculiar interest of the spot, the reason why we chose it as a
starting point in our travel through Southern Burgundy, is that here we
have, before our very eyes, visible symbols of four clearly marked stages in
the history of the Duchy; the Gallic, Roman, Gothic, and modern periods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>We will begin with the Gallic period, in the days when C&aelig;sar wrote of
that city, there upon Mont Beuvray; "Bibracte, oppido Aeduorum longe
maximo et copiosissimo";<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and tell, very shortly, the story of the tribe, in
their relations with the Roman conquerors.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The Aedui, concerning whom all our available information comes from
the Latin writers, were a Gallic tribe, inhabiting, approximately, the space
of country bounded on the east by the Sa&ocirc;ne, on the south by the chain of
mountains between the Lyonnais and Auvergne, on the west by the Loire,
and on the north by the valleys of the Vouge, the Oze, the Brenne and
the Yonne. They were a virile, warlike race, that, from a very early
period, had been recognised as the superior of the neighbouring races, among
which the strongest were, perhaps, their enemies and rivals, the Arverni of
mountainous Auvergne. For very many years before the Roman invasion,
there had been intercommunication&mdash;often of an aggressive nature&mdash;between
the Aedui and the Italian races; but it was not until the year 123 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> that
anything in the nature of a direct alliance was formed between the former
and the Romans, although Tacitus and Cicero both allude to them as
"Brothers of the Roman Nation"; and the weaker people naturally would not
be slow to take advantage of the great military strength of the new-comers, if
it could be exercised on their behalf. The occasion soon came to put that
strength to the test, when, after a series of quarrels with the Arverni and
other neighbouring tribes, the latter summoned the Germans to their assistance.
The Aedui, feeling that their independence was threatened, sent
their chief Druid priest, Divitiacus, to appeal unto C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>Before we see how he fared, let us glance at this leader, whose
statue stands to-day in the Promenade des Marbres at Autun. The Druids
were the magistrate-priests of their respective cities, where, by the right of
knowledge, riches, birth&mdash;for all were of noble blood&mdash;they exercised almost
despotic power. They were the theologians, philosophers, jurists, astronomers,
physicians, and moralists of their times; they were the educators of
youth, the depositaries of the holy mysteries of their religion, and of the
supernatural forces; the arbitors of life and death&mdash;since no human sacrifice
might be offered without their sanction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>They were also superintendents
of the observance of religious rites, of the practice of the ritual demanded
by the gods. Still subject to those gods, the people would fear the priest not
less than the magistrate. Kings, even, were awed by these mouthpieces
of the most high. Such was he whom the Aedui chose for their ambassador.</p>

<p>Divitiacus went to Rome, and there, in person, pleaded his cause before
the senate. His embassy seems to have been of little apparent effect; but,
though he lost his suit, he gained a friend&mdash;Cicero.</p>

<p>In spite of the Druid's failure, C&aelig;sar's legions were, nevertheless, soon
on their way to Gaul. The Helvetii, coveting the fertile land that lay
beside theirs, decided to attempt its conquest. C&aelig;sar, aided by some
Aeduen troops, who now fought for the first time beneath the eagle, met
the invaders on the banks of the Sa&ocirc;ne,<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and annihilated them in the first
great battle of his life. Henceforth, for a time, the two nations are
brothers. "Aeduii, fratres nostri, pugnant."<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Such they remained; until
the next nation that threatened them&mdash;Ariovistus and his German hordes&mdash;had
suffered the fate of the Helvetii.</p>

<p>It was, however, inevitable that the warlike tribes of Gaul should
endeavour, sooner or later, to throw off the yoke of an alien civilization,
which, while it brought them material blessings of inestimable value&mdash;of
which not the least was the introduction of the vine,&mdash;was, nevertheless,
galling to their spirit of sturdy independence. Soon the Aedui were being
stirred to revolt. Foremost among the discontents, was the leader of the
Aeduen cavalry, Dumnorix, brother to Divitiacus, though his opposite in
character. The trusted ally of C&aelig;sar, and the friend of Cicero, Divitiacus
the Druid accepted philosophically the Roman dominion; his brother, turbulent,
adventurous, restless&mdash;a Prince Rupert of his day&mdash;had other
dreams for his country. C&aelig;sar was about to embark on his second expedition
to Britain, when the news came that Dumnorix, who was under orders
to accompany him, had withdrawn, followed by the Aeduen cavalry.
C&aelig;sar, delaying his embarkation, sent his own cavalry in pursuit, with
orders to kill or capture the rebel, if he refused to submit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon overtaken,
Dumnorix defended himself valiantly, and fell, sword in hand, with the cry
on his lips: "I die a free citizen of a free country."<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> One is tempted
to wish that the people of Autun had raised in the "Place des Marbres,"
beside that of his more philosophic brother, a statue to this gallant leader of
a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>The example of Dumnorix was followed, before long, by almost the
whole of Roman Gaul; the principal cities being quite unable to resist the
temptation offered by the long absence of their enemy at the capital. C&aelig;sar,
writing from Rome, protested vigorously against the ingratitude of the
Aedui. He reminded them of their grievous plight before his legions freed
them; of their decimated armies, of their ravaged land, of the heavy tributes,
the noble hostages wrung from them. But he spoke in deaf ears. The
Aedui had definitely linked their destiny with that of their nation. Only
the final arbitrament of force could be appealed to.</p>

<p>They summoned to a council of war, Vercingetorix, the ablest general of
his day, chief of their hereditary enemies, the Arverni; but, accustomed for
long to regard themselves as the dominant tribe of the Gauls, they offered
him only a subordinate command. His refusal of any command, other than
the highest, was followed by an assembly general of the Gallic tribes at
Bibracte, when, on the matter being put to the vote, the great meeting, with
one voice, proclaimed Vercingetorix their leader.<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The story of his last
desperate struggle against the Romans at Alesia, and of his defeat and
death, do not properly belong to the history of Autun, nor to that of
Bibracte.</p>

<p>Gaul had become a province of the great Roman Empire. A higher
civilisation, already familiar to the conquered tribes, is to impose its dominion,
its architecture, its art, upon the conquered land. Bibracte, the oppidum on
the wooded hills, will echo no more to the shouts of Gauls acclaiming their
general or their victory. Deserted, probably in the first years of the
Christian era, silence reigns henceforth over the hills; silence broken only
by the patter of rain drops, by the moan of the wind, or the weird howl of
the wolf, roaming, at midnight, among the ruins of the abandoned city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, here, upon the plain below, another and fairer city was
arising&mdash;Augustodunum, the Roman capital of Gaul, now known as Autun.
It has often been asserted that the location of Bibracte upon Mont Beuvray
is merely legendary, and that Autun is the historic site of the great city of
the Aedui. But this theory, as we have seen, has been finally exploded by
the researches of M. Bulliot. He proves conclusively, not only that Bibracte
was situate on the summit of Beuvray, but also that Autun was built upon
virgin soil, and not upon the site of a Gallic city, which would inevitably
have yielded tangible proof of its existence in Gaulish coins and other remains.
The proportion of Gaulish to Roman coins found in Autun, up to the
present time, is about one to fifteen hundred.<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Further evidence is offered
by the fact that the city conforms to the requirements mentioned by
Vitruvius at the time of its erection&mdash;about fifteen to ten years before the
Christian era&mdash;that, in building a town, the first necessity is to choose a
healthy site, elevated, not subject to fogs, of good temperature, not exposed
to extremes of heat and cold, away from marshy land, and facing south or
west.<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> One of the chief features of Burgundian towns is the excellence
of their sites. This feature, due no doubt, to Roman example, is nowhere
more noticeable than at Autun, which remains to-day one of the best situate,
and among the most interesting, of all the cities of France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first thing to be done, it seems to me, in exploring such a place as
Autun, which comprises a medi&aelig;val and a modern town within the
Enceinte of a Roman city, is to get your bearings, to orient yourself, as the
French say.</p>

<p class="pmb2">On the previous evening, looking up from our sunset seat on the grass,
beside that mysterious pile known as the Temple of Janus, we had seen, far
above the city, to the south-east, on the slope of the hills which enthrone
Autun, a gaunt, grey stone lifting its head over the village roofs of Couhard.
The next morning found us descending the Rue St. Pancras, into the hollow
that lies between the village and the town. As we climbed the ascent, the
rising sun gave us alluring glimpses of the mysterious stone, seen through
the curling mists of an autumn morning; yet, many a time, we turned from
it, to watch the light playing upon ancient wall and tower, and gilding the
spire of the cathedral of St. Lazare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">

  <p class="center font09">Autun &mdash; shewing Cathedral and Medi&aelig;val Towers</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">A bend to the left brought us into
Couhard, a straggling group of dishevelled cottages and huts lining the
Ruisseau de la Toison, that bubbles merrily along the side of the hill. It
is a dilapidated, picturesque, tangled village, given over to ducks and dirt,
and to washerwomen, who, like flies in summer, settle upon the running
waters of France, to wash their toisons d'or.</p>

<p>"Quite an ancient, conservative, stagnant village," we were saying to ourselves;
"built beside a Roman burial ground, and itself going its dirty way
to death"&mdash;when, suddenly, we made a discovery. Couhard is not conservative.
On the contrary, it is advanced. Before us, on a placard, we
read: "Association des Femmes de Sa&ocirc;ne et Loire. Les Femmes doivent
Voter." And they tell you there is no feminist movement in France!</p>

<p>Here is the Pierre de Couhard; a gaunt, uncouth, pointed mass of rubble,
rising from the hillside, in the midst of a little tangled island&mdash;the dust bin
of the village&mdash;where every ill weed grows. 'Tis a characteristic setting for
a Burgundian monument.</p>

<p>But the stone is impressive. Inchoate, formless, it yet suggests a lost
form, that of a corpse long-exposed, or of the mysterious, human-inhuman
figure, that the mad sculptor, in Andreev's story, hewed out, after he had
talked with one returned from the dead, and had gazed deep into death's
basilisk eyes.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="pmb2">A close inspection reveals the truth&mdash;that the Pierre de Couhard was in
the form of a quadrangular pyramid upon a cubical base&mdash;the lower part faced
with large blocks of sandstone, the pyramidal portion with limestone. All
the facing has suffered the usual fate of similar work in France&mdash;it formed
the quarry from which the peasants of Couhard built and maintained their
village. On the south-east side of the pyramid are two holes, bored about
the year 1640, with the intention of discovering whether the monument was
hollow within.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is now believed to be solid throughout. The Aeduen
Society, and others, have undertaken excavations at various times; but local
antiquaries have not yet discovered any cella containing coins or relics that
determine the date of erection, which, however, M. de Fontenay, with good
reason, assigns to the reign of Vespasian (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 69-79).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_019.jpg" width="511" height="650" alt="Autun; Pierre de Couhard" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">As to the purpose of the Pierre, there is now little reason to doubt that
it was a memorial stone; a supposition borne out, not only by the shape of
the monument, but by its position at the summit of the Champs Des Urnes,
as it is popularly called, the great burial ground which bordered the Roman
road from Lyons to Autun.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the same opinion was adopted, after a long examination
and discussion, by that mighty hunter, and amateur antiquary, Francis I.,
when he came here, in August, 1521, accompanied by his mother, Louise de
Savoie, and by his wife, Claude de France. While the ladies visited the
Churches and Convents, which, to them, were the superior attraction, the
merry monarch did the round of the Roman monuments, and afterwards
restored his jaded faculties with a day's hunting in the neighbouring forest of
Planoise, where he lost himself, and might have passed the night in the
wilds had he not happened upon the old castle of Porcheresse, whose lord,
Celse de Traves, led him back to Autun. The delighted populace, anxious
over their lost king, received him with "chiming bells and flaming torches."<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Yet, however great the preparations and rejoicings with which the inhabitants
received their monarch&mdash;as, five years earlier, they had welcomed his
predecessor, Charles VIII.&mdash;it was neither a flourishing nor a cheerful town
that Francis looked down upon, from the Pierre de Couhard, on that summer
day, nearly four hundred years ago. He saw the towers, spires, and gables
of a medi&aelig;val city&mdash;one might almost say, of two medi&aelig;val cities&mdash;built
upon the ruins of the much larger Roman town, the silent immensity
of whose shattered walls, palaces, temples, and amphitheatre, dwarfed into
insignificance the small houses amongst which they stood, and chilled, with
a nameless fear, the hearts of those who watched the shadows of evening
falling about them, and heard the spirit voices of the past calling, in the
moonlight, from among the haunted stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Less fortunate than Dijon and other towns of Burgundy, Autun had
suffered a sequence of disasters. When Francis I. saw the town, neither
the Roman walls nor the Roman buildings had recovered from the ravages
of Tetricus, King of the Gauls, who, about the year 269, after a siege of
seven months, sacked Augustodunum, leaving it in such a pitiable condition
that the emperor Constantine, when he came from Rome in 310, could not
restrain his tears at the sight of the wasted country and ruined towns through
which he had passed; nor could the banners of the corporation, the statues
of the gods, nor the groups of musicians at the secret corners, blind the
emperor to the real poverty hidden beneath official pomp.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>There is no better spot than the Pierre de Couhard from which to picture
Augustodunum as it was on that day when Constantine rode through
the Porte de Rome, now known as the Porte des Marbres, which then stood
where the cemetery now abutts on to the end of the Rue de la Jambe de
Bois. Thence the main street of the city, the Voie d'Agrippa, bordered
by the important and imposing buildings, such as the Temple of Apollo, the
Schools, the Forum, and the Capitol, ran in a straight line to the Porte
d'Arroux, nearly in the direction of the Temple of Janus, still faintly visible
to-day, far away on the plain beyond the river. This Voie d'Agrippa
roughly bisected the Roman town, all the streets of which were laid out,
like those of a modern American City, either parallel or at right angles to
that axial line. Augustodunum, though it lacked the lovely gables, lofty
spires, and pleasant disorder of Gothic Autun, must yet have shown to the
traveller looking back from the road to Rome, a splendid pile of temples and
palaces and gardens, as his glance wandered from the gleaming marble gates,
and the flashing dome of the Capitol, to the majestic arches and sculptured
columns and colonnades of the great arena and lovely theatre, whose ruins
are yet seen through the avenue of lime trees, above the ivy-crowned stones
of the ancient enceinte.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Lovely is this spectacle, even to-day. On the left, to the south-west, the
medi&aelig;val city, the Castrum, lifts its pile of gabled, palace roofs above the
sombre firs, and line of bronzed fortresses, walls, and leaf-clad towers that
mark the Roman enceinte. Higher yet, over all, the spires and pinnacles of
the cathedral of St. Lazare glitter against the background of hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way back, our attention was divided between the glories of that
view, and the "chasse aux poules" or chicken hunt&mdash;the one form of
sport indulged in by the old ladies of a Burgundian village.</p>

<p>A very few hours in Autun were enough to reveal the fact that this
largest Gallo-Roman city of Burgundy contains Roman remains as interesting
as any in France, known to me, excepting those of Nimes, Orange, and
Arles; while, around two of them&mdash;the Temple of Janus<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the Pierre
de Couhard&mdash;there still lingers an element of mystery that renders them
doubly attractive to the curious mind.</p>

<p>The "Temple de Janus" lies, as the reader will remember, at the foot
of Autun, in the meadow beside the Arroux. Its original purpose is doubtful.
M. Viollet le Duc held it to be a Fort D&eacute;tach&eacute;, built outside the
ramparts, for the purpose of barring the passage of the river, and commanding
the plain.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> M. de Fontenay, on the other hand, asserts,&mdash;and I venture
to think proves,&mdash;that the building was not designed for military purposes,
and was, in fact, a temple; though there is no evidence to tell us to which
deity it was dedicated.<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p class="pmb2">M. le Duc contends that the tower had no door on the ground floor, and
was entered by means of a ladder; but one of the features that first strike
any observer who is endeavouring mentally to reconstruct the building, is,
that, along both remaining walls, between the lower openings and the
upper windows, run two lines of rectangular holes pierced in the masonry.
The purpose of those holes, was, undoubtedly, to carry the roof timbers of
a peristyle, or outer gallery, whose foundations have been unearthed at a
distance of between five and six metres from the main wall,&mdash;a discovery
which seems at once to demolish M. le Duc's theory of entry by ladder.
The design of the peristyle is not known, nor the order of its architecture;
but it probably took the ordinary form of a stylobate, or base, columns with
capitals supporting an entablature, and a sloping roof. The niches on the
interior sides of the walls, and the traces of red colouring&mdash;a mixture of
powdered brick and chalk, still easily visible in their more protected parts&mdash;are
further evidence that the tower was indeed a temple.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">M. de Fontenay
dates the building, conjecturally, from the founding of Autun. Concerning
its popular name, "Temple of Janus," he has some very interesting
information to give.</p>

<p>It appears that, until the 17th century, the tower was known as the "Tour
de la G&ecirc;netoie," a term which a local savant took to be a corruption of
Janitect, "&agrave; Jani tecto." This legend was accepted by the historians for
about the next two centuries, until, in 1843, another Burgundian writer
reluctantly announced the truth,&mdash;that G&ecirc;netoie did not mean "Temple of
Janus," but simply, "Champ des balkins" or "genets," the broom known
to all Englishmen as the device of our Plantagenet kings. So much for the
Temple of Janus. Whatever may have been its purpose, no one who has
visited Rome, looking up at the huge, shattered walls, gilded by the sunset,
standing out against the purple shadows of the hills far away across the
plain, can fail to recall memories of the Roman Campagna.</p>

<p>The Roman city of Augustodunum possessed four gates, at the north-west,
north-east, south-west, and south-east corners of the town, leading to
the roads for Boulogne, Besan&ccedil;on, Bourbon L'Archambaud, and Lyons
respectively. The first and last of these was known also as the "Voie
d'Agrippa." The gates, taking them in the same order, are known as the
Porte d'Arroux, the Porte St. Andr&eacute;, the Porte St. Andoche, and the Porte
de Rome. The first two of these are still standing; the others have
disappeared.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The Porte d'Arroux is distant only a few minutes walk from the Temple of
Janus, near the river, at the foot of the Faubourg d'Arroux. Incomplete
though it is, the grace and dignity of the fallen monument yet contrast
strongly with the squalor of its setting. It is backed, on either side, by a
medley of disreputable villas, and dilapidated, half-timbered cottages, whose
squalor is not without charm. To-day hordes of ragged children play beneath
the arches that once echoed to the roll of chariot wheels, and to the tramp
of lictors' feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 610px;">

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

The Porte d'Arroux has four openings for traffic,&mdash;two large central
arches, by which chariots could pass in and out, and two smaller gates, at
the sides, for foot passengers. Each of the central arches is grooved for a
portcullis, which some authorities, including M. Viollet le Duc, think were
not added till the middle ages,<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> a supposition that M. de Fontenay seems
effectually to disprove by pointing out that, since the Roman rampart at that
period was broken down in many places, any additional defences to the gates
would have been a useless precaution.</p>

<p>Autun, in medi&aelig;val times, comprised what were, in effect, two distinct
towns, both built within the Roman enceinte. These were the Castrum,
the centre of which was the Cathedral of St. Lazare, and the Marchaux&mdash;still
known by the same name,&mdash;in the lower part of the town, north of the
Place des Champs de Mars. Each of these towns was then sheltered within
its own walls and towers, of which portions are still in existence.</p>

<p>The upper part of the gate consisted of a pierced gallery or arcade, of
ten bays,&mdash;seven of them still intact,&mdash;forming a Chemin de Ronde, on a
level with that running along the crest of the Roman wall. This gallery,
serving the double purpose of ornament and defence, could be closed at any
time by wooden shutters.<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The gate was flanked on either side by two
rectangular towers (corps de garde) with semi-circular apses projecting far
beyond it, as though&mdash;in the phrase of Eumenes, a local historian and
orator of the late 3rd and early 4th centuries&mdash;they were stretching out
welcoming arms to those about to enter the town.<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>All who are interested in the development of Burgundian architecture,
should give careful attention to the Porte d'Arroux, which is certainly the
source of one of the most marked characteristics of the style,&mdash;the use of
the fluted pilasters, which, for some reason or other, seem to have struck the
fancy of the architects of this part of France. We shall see this arcade
imitated closely in the triforium gallery of the cathedral of St. Lazare, and
also influencing, in turn, the churches of Cluny, Paray le Monial, Notre
Dame de Beaune, and others.</p>

<p>The masonry of the gate is very finely executed, with close joints, without
mortar, in the manner of the period, and is, on the whole, in a wonderfully
good state of preservation. The lower part of the work is quite
plain. The archivolts, the entablature, including the architrave and the
frieze, show little ornament; the cornice, however, is richly decorated with
dentals, palmettes and other designs, as is also the remaining fragment of
cornice above the arcade, whose fluted pilasters have beautiful capitals in the
Corinthian style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The other surviving Roman gate,&mdash;the Porte St. Andr&eacute;,&mdash;is on the north-east
boundary of the city, not far from the Porte d'Arroux, by way of the
Faubourg Arroux and the Rue de la Croix Blanche. It is less picturesquely
situate, and, though very similar, is distinctly inferior to its neighbour in
design and finish. The central arches are lower, and heavier, while the
gallery lacks the lightness and grace which are characteristic of the Porte
d'Arroux, and is, moreover, built in a stone darker and less pleasing to the
eye than the oolithic limestone of the lower portion.</p>

<p>M. de Fontenay suggests that this upper part was restored at some later
and degenerate period of Roman architecture. Certainly the plain pilasters
are badly designed and carelessly set, while the capitals, of a composite, semi-ionic order,
appear to be too narrow for their pilasters&mdash;not too wide, as stated
by M. de Fontenay, and also by M. D&eacute;chelette in his careful little guide to
Autun. The Porte St. Andr&eacute; shows no signs of having been fitted with a
portcullis. Hamerton<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> states, no doubt correctly, that the door was barred
by strong beams inserted into holes and grooves. These are still visible.</p>

<p>The Porte St. Andr&eacute;, it should be noted, is one of the most complete
Roman gates existing in France. The lower portion of one of the flanking
towers, which rose originally several feet above the attic story of the gate,
owes its escape from destruction to its shape, which, coinciding with that of
a typical Romanesque chapel, tempted certain ecclesiastics of the middle ages,
to dedicate it to St. Andr&eacute;, as a place for Christian worship.<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These flanking
towers comprised three stories. The first communicated with the
Chemin de Ronde, along the crest of the walls, the second was a vaulted
chamber, and the third remained open to the sky. Access was obtained by a
double staircase.</p>

<p>On the question of the period during which these gates were built, M. de
Fontenay and Viollet le Duc are again at variance,&mdash;the latter attributing
them to the fourth or fifth centuries,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the former to the reign of Vespasian
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 69-79).<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Strange as it may seem that another writer should contradict
continually so eminent an authority as the last-named, the author of
"Autun et ses Monuments" again has reason on his side, since he can
refer to the orator Eumenes as describing the gates in the year 311 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, since the Roman walls were admittedly broken down in many
places during the siege by Tetricus, in the year 269 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,&mdash;an event of
which Eumenes was a witness,&mdash;and the inhabitants were already beginning
to retire within the safer precincts of the Citadel; what would be the reason
for erecting elaborate gates on the line of the ruined wall? I am not an
authority upon ancient architecture; but I was certainly astonished to read
the date given in the "Dictionnaire Raisonn&eacute;"; and I should be glad to
know whether other experts support M. le Duc's theory.</p>

<p>Of the two other gates&mdash;the Porte St. Andoche, on the south-west, and
the Porte de Rome on the south-east, in the direction of Lyons,&mdash;nothing
remains except the rectangular portion of one of the lateral towers of the
former. The loss of the Porte de Rome, or the "Porte des Marbres," as it
was popularly called, is especially to be regretted, since that name alone
suggests the truth, of which evidence exists, that it was by far the most
beautiful of the four. Moreover, it has additional historic interest as being
the gate by which Constantine entered Autun in 311.</p>

<p>The old writers agree in describing the Porte des Marbres as a thing of
beauty,&mdash;a quality which was its undoing, as offering an irresistible attraction
to the Medi&aelig;val and later builders. Several ancient Corinthian
capitals, not otherwise easily accounted for, are to be seen to-day in
the porch of the cathedral built at the close of the 12th century.
It appears, indeed, that around the present site of the Fountain of the
Pelican was a burial ground named Les Marbres, on account of its richness
in borrowed sculpture. The site of the gate was known from the 14th
century onwards as "&agrave; Marbres" or "de Marboribus." At the time of
the construction of the bastion of the Jambe de Bois, the workmen unearthed
many marbles, including columns, capitals, and bases of the
Corinthian or some composite order.<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The date of the final destruction
of the Porte des Marbres is uncertain; but its flanking towers, then known
as the Fors de Marboribus, were still standing in the middle of the 14th
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Before beginning another chapter, let me speak one word of warning. If
you ask one of the humbler inhabitants of Autun where the Porte St.
Andoche stood, you will be directed, without hesitation,&mdash;as we were,&mdash;to
the bank of the river, near the railway station. Having reached that spot
and crossed the bridge, you will obtain a lovely view of the Roman wall and
the river beside it, but will fail to find the remaining tower of the gate, for
the reason that it is not there. The Porte St. Andoche stood at the foot of
the Boulevard Schneider, opposite to the Couvent du Sacrement, on the road
leading, by way of the enceinte, to the Tour des Ursulines.</p>

<p>The reader may ask why the peasants should misdirect him? They misdirect
him, in this particular instance, because they believe that the gate really
stood on the town side of the western bridge of the Arroux, in the corresponding
position to that of the Porte d'Arroux. But my point is, that, had
your informant been utterly ignorant of the supposed whereabouts of the
gate, he would, very probably, have directed you with almost equal facility.
The Burgundian peasant is very ignorant; but he is also very proud,&mdash;much
too proud to admit that he does not know the whereabouts of a monument
that a stranger has come, perhaps, a thousand miles to visit. His swift
imagination, therefore, promptly creates the site; and he, or she, will tell
you promptly, volubly, and with much circumstantial detail, exactly how to
get there. In this snare we have been taken many times during our travels
among the Burgundians. The Proven&ccedil;als have a different and preferable
method. They do not invent a site for the monument; they deny its
existence. Speaking with some experience of the peculiar ways of the
French peasant in such matters, my advice to the gentle stranger is&mdash;not to
trust him. Get the best guide and map that you can find in the local
librairie; and rely on them, and on your own intelligence. You may then,
when you are at fault, consult the passer by as to details, letting your judgment
decide whether, in his particular case, he is to be trusted.</p>

<p>If it be a Ch&acirc;teau that you are seeking, you must be doubly careful. To
a French peasant many a tiny cottage is a "fine house" (belle maison), and
almost every modern house, of any pretentions at all, is a ch&acirc;teau. To us,
on the contrary, a ch&acirc;teau means a castle; usually an ancient one.</p>

<p>Many a time has a blue-shirted peasant looked up from his work by the
road side, to address me somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>"The Ch&acirc;teau de Bon Espoir; Certainly, Monsieur, 'tis there, three
kilometres away, up the hill, tout droit en montant."<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>We climb the three kilometres, wander about for an hour, and return
disconsolate. The labourer, hearing the whirr of bicycle wheels, looks up
again.</p>

<p>"M'sieur et Dame have found the Ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur. They told us up there that the ancient Ch&acirc;teau de Bon
Espoir was on the other side of the valley to the north."</p>

<p>"Oh! that one? That's only an old ruin. I thought you meant the
ch&acirc;teau de Monsieur Pigot."</p>

<p>"No. Who is Monsieur Pigot?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Pigot, 'Sieur Dame, is the proprietor of the grand magasin
du Louvre at Paris. He has a lovely ch&acirc;teau, up there where you went.
They would have let you in if you had gone up the drive."</p>

<p>"We are sorry we missed it. Good day, Monsieur."</p>

<p class="pmb2">The "lovely ch&acirc;teau" was a terrible erection of red brick and stone,
defiling the landscape for a mile around.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Leaving the Hotel St. Louis, about which I shall have more to say later on,
and passing along the Rue de l'Arquebus, you emerge upon an open space,
where stands a statue to a Gaulish chieftain with whom we have already
made acquaintance&mdash;the Druid, Divitiacus.</p>

<p>It may be heresy on my part, but I must admit that I have very little sympathy
with the French passion for erecting statues of known or unknown
persons, in every public place, quite irrespective of any ulterior considerations,
such as whether such a monument is in any way expressive of the
celebrity's particular talent or genius, or whether modern garments in carved
stone are desirable in a "Place," often bordered with the most beautiful
examples of Gothic or Renaissance architecture.</p>

<p>Many an open space in the ancient cities of France might have been
spared such an indignity, had the French people cared to remember that, in
the absence of a more worthy memorial&mdash;such as a house that can be lived
in&mdash;a wall-tablet is sufficient for all practical purposes. M. Emile
Mont&eacute;gut, in his "Souvenirs de Bourgogne," has very justly satirized the
French idiosyncracy; but France in general, and Burgundy in particular,
still bristles with unnecessary statues.</p>

<p>The memorial of Divitiacus, however, is an exception to the general
rules, for the figure is a successful and spirited piece of work, showing the
Druid, bareheaded, pointing down the Roman Road. His helmet lies at
his feet, and he carries a shield on which a battle scene is engraved. The
figure stands upon a historic site; for here, on the west side of the Voie
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
d'Agrippa, joining gate with gate, stood three of the most important buildings
of the Roman city,&mdash;the Temple of Apollo, the Schools, and the
Capitol.</p>

<p>The Aedui had always conceived of Apollo as surrounded by the Muses.
He was their God of poetry, of youth, of joy, of prosperity, and of beauty;
he was the healer and enlightener; to him the woods and streams were
consecrated in the days</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When holy were the haunted forest boughs,</span>
<span class="i2">Holy the air, the water, and the fire;"</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the third century the Healer was already the most venerated of the
Roman divinities in the hierarchy of Augustodunum, and his temple was
probably the most important of them all, until 270, when it fell, with many
another Roman temple and palace, before the hordes of Tetricus.</p>

<p>The Emperor Constantius Chlorus, however, decided that the temples
should rise again; and it appears, from the records of Eumenes, that, by the
end of the third century, the house of "Apollo Noster" was restored to
more than its former beauty. The house was restored; but not the cult.
Influences more powerful than the decree of Constance Chlore, or of
Constantine, were at work within the Roman city. Every year, meaner
gifts were offered, fewer vows were made before the Temple of Apollo;
every year more citizens&mdash;at first in fearful secrecy, later with open
enthusiasm&mdash;worshipped the Carpenter of Nazareth.</p>

<p>Excavations have revealed the substructure of the circular building which
is generally accepted as having been the Temple of Apollo. The character
of the remains, shewing that strings of bricks were used in the construction
of the building,<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> point to the reign of Constantius Chlorus, or of his son
Constantine,<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> as the probable date. Readers familiar with the Roman
buildings of Arles, will recognise the same architectural feature in the Palace
of Constantine in that town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The great schools of Autun, the Ecoles M&eacute;niennes, as they were called,
were probably situate between the Temple of Apollo and the Capitol, just
below the site of the present Sous-pr&eacute;feture. They appear to have been
well known throughout the Roman Empire; for Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> mentions the
capital of the Aedui as a place where the children of the Gaulish nobility
were wont to apply themselves eagerly to the study of the liberal arts,
while Eumenes speaks of them as "a sanctuary consecrated to instruction
and eloquence, a very home of literature; for," says he, "the study of
letters is the foundation of all the virtues; they are, indeed, a school of temperance,
of modesty, of vigilance, of patience; and when all these virtues
are implanted as a habit in the heart of childhood, they penetrate, like a
vigorous sap, all the functions of civil life, and even those which seem to be
in opposition to it, I mean the charges and duties of military life."<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Many men, celebrated in their day, must have attended these schools,
which seem to have retained their popularity well into the third century,
though, at the time of their destruction in the catastrophy of 270 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
they may, perhaps, have been living, to a certain extent, upon their past
glories. We do not know much concerning their architecture; but Eumenes
says they were known as a monument of imposing beauty, and adds this
interesting detail&mdash;that "the buildings were surrounded by galleries or porticos,
in which the students could see every day the extent of all the lands
and of all the seas, the towns restored by the good-will of the invincible
emperors, the nations conquered by their valour, and the barbarous countries
chained by the terror of their arms. There were shewn the name and
situation of each country, its extent, its relative distance, the source and outfall
of each river, the windings of the banks, and the circuits of the sea
which washes the continents and the shores of the countries swept by its
impetuous movement. The whole universe was there pictured. There
were to be seen the two rivers of Persia, the parched regions of Lybia, the
joined branches of the Rhine, and the many mouths of the Nile."<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The schools had been named after these galleries, on whose walls or
ceilings the young nobles of Gaul could learn all that was known of the
world of their day, that is to say, the whole of the Roman Empire.
Maeniana,&mdash;in French, M&eacute;nienne,&mdash;means a construction projecting from
the front of an edifice, an exterior gallery or balcony, which appears to have
been so common a characteristic of the schools of Augustodunum, that the
term Maeniana came to be applied to them generally.<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>In 270 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> the
schools suffered the general fate, and the scholars, henceforth, had to be
accommodated in separate quarters. Eumenes talked of restoring the porticos,
and repainting the map of the world; but, probably, the work was
never carried out, and the schools remained in their shattered state, even
after the adjoining buildings&mdash;the Temple of Apollo and the Capitol&mdash;had
been restored to something of their former glory.</p>

<p>The Capitol was probably the building whose foundations, circular on
plan, have been traced to the garden of the Hospice St. Gabriel, beside the
Ecoles M&eacute;niennes, and fronting also upon the great central street leading
from gate to gate. Authorities appear to have differed considerably on this
point; but many Corinthian capitals, fragments of entablatures, statuettes,
groups of goddesses, etc., have been found on this site, suggesting that it was
once occupied by a building of great importance,<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> decorated as one would
expect of such a temple, and dedicated, as the Capitol was, to the principal
divinities of the official hierarchy. Eumenes, moreover, states that the
Capitol was situate beside the schools. M. de Fontenay, however, thinks
that, possibly, the Capitol may have occupied the other circular site, now
attributed to the Temple of Apollo; and, conversely, that the latter building
should be placed below the schools.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not far from this centre of Roman civilization, beyond the shady
plantation of plane trees, the Promenade des Marbres, dotted with seats of
Roman stone, and stretching eastward from the statue of Divitiacus, you
will find, if you follow the Faubourg des Marbres, on the right side of the
downward slope, a board with the legend "Caves Joyaux." Then, turning
up the path to the right, passing a hideous modern cottage devoted principally
to "tir," from the walls of which the counterfeit presentments of dead
citizens look out stonily upon you from the Roman stele, you will come
upon a grassy, semi-circular terrace, planted with lime trees, whose green
banks slope down towards a smaller semi-circle of sward below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond it lies a broad expanse of allotment garden, in which peasant
women are bending over their crops. Standing among the leaves, that, on
this bright autumn day, are fluttering upon the grass, and looking down more
closely into the semi-circle, one observes irregularities in the surface of the
horseshoe, lines suggestive of terracing; strangely shaped, hollow, grassy
boulders that seem to have shouldered their way up from below. Here, at
the end of the curve, is a mass of broken stone; there a black shadow below
the revealed head of an arch projecting from the weed-entangled d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>The reader will have guessed his whereabouts. This is, or was, the
Roman theatre. Upon those heavy shoulders rested the marble seats; there
were the entrances and exits by which the spectators passed to and from the
staircases and corridors. From the flat semi-circle below us, the chorus
chanted their melodious comments upon the play that was being enacted on
the stage where now the women are at work.</p>

</div>

<p>There are those who will tell you that the Theatre is not worth the
trouble of a visit,&mdash;that it has lost all charm. I cannot agree. On the
contrary, ruined though the monument is, hardly one stone of it left upon
another, there is nothing more impressive to be seen in Autun; for the
general contour of the building is so preserved, that, for any person in the
least degree familiar with the forms of these monuments, no great effort of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the imagination is needed to restore the play-house to some of its ancient
glory, and to re-people it with the voices of the past. Moreover, the
spectator, though he cannot see the graceful columns, that, probably, as at
Arles, rose from the back of the stage, nor the sculptured frieze, nor the
marble capitals and statues that adorned the proscenium, nor the arcaded
gallery that crowned the upper rows of seats, though he may not follow with
the eye the distant white roads of Vesentio and Agrippa; yet still his glance
can range over the same landscape that met the Roman of old, the near fields
and meadows, the distant uplands and gloomy forest lit by the rising sun.</p>

<p>Still more impressive must the theatre be, when moonlight has shed her
revealing mystery over the terraces of this forsaken garden.</p>

<p>Tradition has it, that, until the latter part of the 17th century, a considerable
portion of the Roman theatre was still standing; and M. de
Fontenay gives a very interesting sketch of the ruins in 1610, showing
that soil and d&eacute;bris had not then obliterated the tiers of seats, and that
the fore-part and the arcaded gallery of the semi-circle were still in
existence.<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This comparatively happy condition of affairs might have
endured until to-day, but for an unfortunate temptation that overcame
Gabriel de Roquette, Bishop of Autun, in 1675, to make use of the Roman
theatre as a quarry for the new seminary he was building. It was a deed
doubly inexcusable, because, at so late a period, after the publication of
Eden Thomas' book, and others dealing with the subject, he had no longer
the commonly-urged excuse that no interest was taken in the ancient
monuments of Autun.<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It is quite possible, however, that we are blaming
the bishop needlessly. After the fate of Cluny, who shall say of what a
Frenchman is not capable, when the lust of destruction is upon him?</p>

<p>The theatre of Autun was 147m.80. in diameter, the largest in Gaul,
and the fourth largest of the known buildings of the kind; coming immediately
after that of Bacchus at Athens, and those of Ephesus and Smyrna.<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The orchestra was paved in red marble, and the stage lined with white
marble veined with red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The exterior arcades of the hemi-cycle were
formed of large blocks, the space between ornamented with pater&aelig;. Anfert's,
the oldest description we have, dating from the 17th century, mentions that
the circumference of the theatre is broken by several chambers and subterranean
passages; these chambers are vaulted; they are seven or eight feet
wide, and known as "Caves Jolliot."<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>This brings us back to the legend "Caves Joyaux," which greeted our
approach to the theatre. Up to the end of the 16th century, the remains
appear to have been known as the "Grotto" (Grottes), an interesting
example of the extraordinary vulgarity of popular nomenclature. Later,
a certain worthy Autunois, whose line of business has not come down to us
with his name, decided that these vaulted chambers would suit him excellently
as a domicile. No doubt his venture proved successful, for the Grotto
soon became known as the "Cellier Jolyot," or "Caves Jolyot," a name
which, in the form of "Caves Joyaux," still passes current among the
vulgar of Autun.<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is by no means the first time that the substructure
of a Roman monument has been dubbed "cellars" by an indiscriminating
public.</p>

<p>For us the Roman theatre was more than a historic relic,&mdash;it was our
favourite lunching place in Autun! However severe a shock the admission
may be to some of my readers, I admit boldly, that never, during
all our travels in France, do we, if we can avoid it, lunch either in restaurant
or hotel. To go twice a day, with credit, through the six courses of a
French d&eacute;jeuner and dinner, is a gastronomic effort of which we confess
ourselves wholly incapable; consequently, before setting forth on our day's
excursion, we may be seen passing into the &eacute;picerie, boulangerie, or other
boutique of the village street, whence, our pockets bulging with sundry small
paper parcels, we emerge, amid the not wholly disinterested curiosity of all
the old ladies who have been eyeing us from door and window during our
journey down the street.</p>

<p>The custom of picnic lunches is one that I recommend to all travellers in
Burgundy, including those to whom the saving of a five-pound note, at the
end of a month's holiday, is a matter of no moment whatever. The
Burgundians feed more richly, perhaps, than any other people of Europe, and
their dinners, like the country's monuments&mdash;rich rather than dainty&mdash;need a
healthy appetite to do them justice. Further, the secrecy that these picnic
methods necessarily involve&mdash;for you cannot proclaim your intention to a
ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, whose luncheon tables groan beneath their burden of good
things appointed for you to eat,&mdash;will titillate deliciously the insatiable
curiosity of the lady his wife, who passes hours in wondering where and
how you lunched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_038.jpg" width="180" height="312" alt="A Burgundian Welcome" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Monsieur et Dame will not be in to
lunch to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame."</p>

<p>"Monsieur et Dame were not in to lunch
yesterday."</p>

<p>"No, Madame." A pause, during which
our hostess, screwing up her courage for the
plunge, eyed us with a glance, half-timid, half-amused.</p>

<p>"Where did Monsieur et Dame lunch
yesterday?" The speaker looked at my wife;
my wife looked at me. I looked innocently
at Madame.</p>

<p>"On a wall, Madame." Madame's eyebrows
rose slightly. She could make nothing
of it.</p>

<p>"But it was raining all day yesterday,
Monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Not on the wall, Madame. The fact is,
we never lunch at an hotel&mdash;even when it
rains."</p>

<p>"Vous faites bien" was what she said to us. What she said to her
husband, an hour later, I leave to the reader to guess. But we parted
excellent friends.</p>

<p>These picnic lunches, of course, are rather scrappy. Things get blown
away sometimes, or are fastened upon by ants. Il faut souffrir pour bien
vivre.</p>

<p>While I have been writing these notes, my wife has left the bench of
Roman stone that is our table, and is seated on the grass half way down
towards the orchestra, where she is exercising her not inconsiderable powers
of imagination in recreating the traditions of the spot. Also she is proving,
unwittingly, the excellent acoustic properties of the natural theatre, constructed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
in the Greek, rather than in the Roman method; that is to say, by
hollowing out of the hill, not building up upon the plain. The keeper of
the buvette told us that a play is to be given in the theatre next June (1911)
and "a little bull-fight."</p>

<p>Going back to the hotel that day, we noticed, among the crisp leaves of
the Promenade des Marbres, many a handful of confetti,&mdash;souvenirs of the
great fair or festival of St. Lazare, that, for nearly the whole of September,
disturbs the tranquillity of Autun. Let the traveller, therefore, see the
Roman city before September, or after it.</p>

<p>The stone benches beneath the trees of the Promenade des Marbres,
placed there about 1765, appear to have been taken from another of the most
important Roman monuments of Autun, the Amphitheatre, a building which,
in the middle ages, was known by the same name as its neighbour, the
Theatre, and suffered a similar fate. It was situate to the north of the
Caves Joyaux, close to the wall of the town, in such a position that the
Faubourg des Marbres nearly bisects its site. Not very much is known
concerning it; but its dimensions have been determined by excavations that
prove it to have been the largest of the known amphitheatres of France,
as it is of Burgundy as a whole.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Here are the figures, compared with those of the Ar&egrave;nes of Arles and
Nimes, both of which still exist.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p class="p1">M. de Fontenay publishes in his work, a drawing which shows that, in
1610, there remained of the amphitheatre two parallel, vaulted arcades; but
he does not venture on an attempt to reconstruct the building. It appears
that, by the 18th century, all trace of the construction had vanished, except
the oval site, which, being at a lower level than the surrounding land, is still
popularly known as the Crot-Volu (Creux Volu), the latter name being
that of a 14th century family who occupied part of it.<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> One of the
most significant discoveries made among the ruins was that of the skull of
a lion, probably the victim of a gladiator. It is supposed that the amphitheatre
was built contemporaneously with the theatre, and, in the year of the
siege, suffered the same fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>A walk round the quiet roads and avenues of this outlying portion of
Autun, and half an hour spent on the grassy slopes of the theatre, cannot
fail to impress the most casual observer with a sense of the grandeur and
extent of the Roman city. Modern Autun is a town of respectable dimensions;
but here, within the Roman Enceinte, the few dwelling houses stand
isolated among their own gardens; and ancient, immemorial trees cast their
shadows over quiet spots once resounding with the hum and rumour of
Roman life.</p>

<p class="pmb3">All those who would visualize Burgundian history will be grateful that,
in spite of the destructive enmity of her foes, and the scarcely less destructive
ignorance and folly of certain of her inhabitants, enough of Augustodunum
is left to enable us to group round her our mental pictures of this part of
Gallo-Roman Burgundy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p class="p2">After two or three days among the relics of Pagan civilization, we were
ready to turn our attention to Christian monuments of the town, and it was
with our expectations fully aroused that we left what might be described
as the neutral ground of the H&ocirc;tel St. Louis, and climbed the busy streets
that lead within the castrum to the Cathedral of Saint Lazarus, in which
the relics of the saint are enshrined.</p>

<p>Readers unfamiliar with the Proven&ccedil;al legends will ask, not unnaturally,
how the body of Christ's friend came to the city of Autun. The answer is
that, according to tradition, Lazarus, Martha, Mary, and others, driven from
Palestine after the crucifixion of Christ, and cast adrift in an open boat, were
blown, on the wings of a great wind, westward across the Mediterranean,
and eventually, by miraculous aid, were cast ashore, unhurt, on the coast of
Provence. This land they proceeded to evangelize, Lazarus finding his way
to Marseilles, of which city he became the first bishop.<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Nearly a thousand years later, at the end of the 10th century, the body
was translated to Autun, through the efforts of one Gerrard, the then
bishop, and was housed in the basilica of St. Nazaire. So holy a relic
naturally demanded a worthy shrine, and already, during the first quarter of
the 12th century, we find proposals on foot for the erection of a new
church for the housing of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Hamerton, indeed, says that the work
was planned in the 11th century; the original idea being due to Robert <span class="smcap">i.</span>,
Duke of Burgundy.<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This building, the existing cathedral of St. Lazarus,
begun in 1120, was ready for consecration by Pope Innocent II. when he
passed through Autun, in 1132.</p>

<p>Although the work was not completed at this time, the porch, in particular,
being wanting, the Bishop of Autun resolved to take advantage of
the great gathering of V&eacute;zelay, for the preaching of the second crusade, to
announce the translation of the relics. King Louis VII. attended in person,
and the ceremony was performed with great &eacute;clat, on Sunday, October 20th,
1146. Four weeks of continuous rain had given place to warm sunshine,
and enormous crowds of pilgrims gathered to celebrate the event, among
whom were Eudes <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, Duke of Burgundy, and many bishops and nobles.
After the all-night ceremonies which preceded the principal function, two
stonemasons, says the old chronicle, were taken into the church to effect the
opening of the tomb. The stone was raised, the vault exposed, and, to the
sound of the <span class="smcap">te deum</span>, those present pressed forward to venerate the relics.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the ceremony, followed with the fervent religious
emotion characteristic of the time, Humbert de Bage wrapped the body
of St. Lazarus, together with the winding-sheet and the deerskin bag which
covered it, in a silken covering, and with new straps bound the precious
bundle upon a wooden bearer destined for the solemn translation. Meanwhile,
outside the church, an immense crowd was awaiting admission. Soon
the pressure became so great that the gates of the church were forced, and
the mob broke in with such violence that the iron grill barring the sanctuary
would have been broken, had it not been supported by sheer muscular
effort on the part of the clerks. "Eudes, Duke of Burgundy, William,
Count of Chalon, and other brave nobles, each hurriedly putting down his
chlamys, and arming himself with sword or stick, began to cut and thrust,
right and left, among the crowd, to open a passage for the cort&egrave;ge, which,
with great pomp, was transporting the holy relics to the church of St.
Lazarus. This church, too, was so gorged with humanity, that the
bearers, breathless with fatigue and fright, and despairing of ever reaching
the altar, set down their precious burden upon some wooden planks, where
it long remained in the middle of the nave."<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>During the whole of the following week, the crowd surged round the
holy relics, and miraculous cures followed one another with such rapidity
that the priests engaged in chanting Te Deums, in gratitude for each healing,
were unable to keep pace with the calls made upon them. While prayer,
praise, and cries of "Miracle!" were resounding through the church, blood
was being shed freely outside. A trivial quarrel between some nobles had
strewn the neighbouring streets with wounded men.<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Such contrasts were
a common feature of the age.</p>

<p>The tomb of Lazarus occupied a position in the apse, behind the great
altar. According to the evidence of an eye-witness, it was a monument of
unusual magnificence, built in the form of a church, constructed of
porphyry, and black and white marble. Its sculpture comprised a recumbent
figure of Lazarus, in his winding-sheet, with Christ's word, written below
it, "Lazare veni foras (Lazarus, come forth)." Among other figures were
those of Christ, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and, before the head of Lazarus, two
statues in stone representing Martha and Mary, one of them lifting to her
nose a handkerchief, recalling the "jam foetet" (by this time he stinketh)
of the Gospel story. This priceless monument, interesting to all, doubly
interesting to those who believe that it did, indeed, house the relics
of the friend of Christ, was destroyed during the course of improvements
carried out in the choir of the cathedral during the 18th century; but three
of the figures&mdash;those of St. Andrew, Martha and Mary, are still preserved in
the little Mus&eacute;e Lapidaire of Autun, of which collection they are the gems.
A glance at them reveals the fact that, even at this early epoch, the art of
sculpture was well developed in Autun. The rapt expression of the countenances,
the graceful lines of the draperies, the comparative delicacy of the
execution, without sacrifice of strength, recall something of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman
tradition, that probably had never perished wholly from the Roman
city. That these figures, the work of one Martin, were the result of no
mere sporadic outbreak of genius is proved, I think, by the rapport they bear
with the work of Geraldus, which, when seen in the apse of the Mus&eacute;e,
they instantly recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>But before succumbing to the attractions of that unique porch of the
cathedral of Autun, we could not resist the temptation to get a
first general impression of a building which, we had always been
told, was one of the best to be found, even in this land of beautiful
Romanesque churches. The exterior effect, however, is not entirely
satisfactory, especially if the approach be made by one of the streets
leading up from the middle of the town. The western towers are, indeed,
still Romanesque; but they have been re-handled, not too happily; and the
unity of the whole has been lost by the substitution, for the Romanesque
work, of Gothic side chapels, and pierced parapets of varying designs, with
a profusion of medi&aelig;val and classical ornament, in the spandrels and below
the parapets, all utterly at variance with the simple grandeur of the original
building. Moreover the north-east door, in the tympanum of which was a
magnificent piece of sculpture representing the raising of Lazarus, has been
replaced by a heavy production, of the revolution period, in the latest and
ugliest classical style. The 15th century spire,&mdash;a beautiful piece of work,
somewhat after the manner of that of Lichfield Cathedral,&mdash;has a rather
squat appearance from this lower side of the church. Its grace and lightness,
and the harmony of its proportions, are better seen from the higher lane to
the south-east; but the finish of the spire, is not, in my judgment, wholly
successful. The crocketing is somewhat overdone, and the decoration
rather fussy in treatment.</p>

<p>The original Romanesque tower, which was probably in some danger of
collapse, was at last destroyed by fire. Cardinal Rolin, brother of Nicholas
Rolin, whom we shall meet later on, rebuilt the new tower in 1480. The
state of the foundations necessitated lightness for the new work, which relies
for its security almost wholly upon excellence of construction. The spire,
built without any internal support whatever, is said to be only seven inches
thick at the base, and six towards the summit.<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Towards the close of the
13th century, probably, the walls of the nave, threatening to collapse under
the vault, were supported by flying buttresses surmounted by heavy pinnacles.
These additions, lightened during the 15th century, almost complete the
transformation of the exterior effect from that of a Romanesque to a late
Gothic church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest glory of Autun Cathedral, is its magnificent two-storied,
barrel vaulted, open porch with aisled bays, forming the western entrance.
In the tympanum of the door is the famous sculpture by Geraldus, respresenting
the Last Judgment. Standing at the foot of the noble flight of steps
leading up to the stately hall, where of old the lepers, and the horde of unclean,
torn between the love of life and its miseries, must have trembled and
hoped before that awful vision of judgment, we first realised that here is one
of the most majestic and impressive ante-chambers that Burgundy, or France,
ever built at the gates of her houses of God.</p>

<p>This porch owes its existence indirectly to Clunisian influence, and
directly to the cult of Saint Lazarus. Among the thousands of pilgrims
drawn every year, for solace or for healing, to the sacred tomb, were many
ladres, or lepers, whose admission to the interior of the church would have
been a menace to the public health. Under these circumstances, the
Chapter obtained from Hugues III., Duke of Burgundy, in 1178, permission
to construct a porch, on the condition that it should not be of a military
character.<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This work was duly carried out; but it must not be supposed
that the original was as we see it now. The first porch did not extend as far
as the two side doors, but comprised a vault supported on two walls, whose
position is now represented by two pairs of columns. The ground adjoining
was levelled up to the porch, and the entrance was through an arch pierced
in the eastern wall.<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Some years later, as the cult of St. Lazarus increased,
the porch was modified to its present design. The magnificent flight of
steps, built in the 18th century, was the only improvement that the colossal
foolishness of the revolutionary iconoclasts succeeded in effecting in the
cathedral.</p>

<p>The upper storey of the porch, and the niche in the facade above it, is
also interesting, as being entirely characteristic of the architecture of this
part of France, though limited to a very short period, from about 1130 to
1200.<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In the 13th century, with the advent of developed Gothic, these
appendages disappear.</p>

<p>The magnificent central doorway, taken as a whole, is the best example
of its kind, both as regards design and sculpture, to be seen in Burgundy,
with the exception of V&eacute;zelay, which, politically, belongs rather to the
Nivernais than to the land of the Dukes.</p>

<p>The God in Judgment of the tympanum, one of the most ancient and
complete of the many examples of the subject to be seen in France, is
striking, terrifying almost, in vigour, in that dramatic power which, even
so early, was one of the marked characteristics of Burgundian sculpture.
With hands outstretched He sits between the
elect and the damned. On His left, in the
place of torment, the sinners, weighed in the
angel balance, and found wanting, are handed
over, for torment, to the powers of darkness,
whose bony claws, reaching down, fasten upon
more victims from a sinful world. The hideous
malignity upon the faces of these tormentors, the
twisted, tortured postures of the despairing victims,
all heighten the effect, and contrast strongly
with the still somewhat rigid, though easier, lines
of the other picture, where mighty angels are
lifting into a heavenly mansion the spirits of the
redeemed.</p>

<p>Not less effective, probably, in execution and
symbolism, was the figure of the door-post upon
which rests this early conception of the world's
destiny. Here was Lazarus, who triumphed
over death, and beside him, his sisters, Martha
and Mary, symbols of two aspects of personal
service. The original statues were destroyed at
the Revolution, but the lines of their substitutes,
among the most successful modern imitations
that I know, have still, in form and drapery,
something of Hellenic delicacy, suggesting that
the original sculptor's eye was lit by the dying
radiance of Grecian art, or by the herald beams
of an earlier, unremembered Renaissance. The
author of this ancient sculpture is known. He
has written his name above the lintel: "Gisilbertus
hoc fecit."</p>

<p>I need not enumerate all the other subjects of
the carvings on this beautiful porch; the reader
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
will not have any difficulty in discovering some of them for himself&mdash;Jerome
and his Lion; Hagar and Ishmael driven out by Abraham; Balaam and the
Ass; the Presentation in the Temple; and, on the archivolt, the signs of the
Zodiac.</p>

<p>It is curious that Voltaire appears to have had some influence, good and
bad&mdash;the good was involuntary&mdash;over the destiny of this porch of Autun.
While staying at the Ch&acirc;teau of Montjeu, where he attended the marriage
of the Duc de Richelieu, he condescended to visit the cathedral, and so
ridiculed the barbarism of its architecture, and especially of its sculptured
adornments, that the Canons had the whole of the great tympanum plastered
over, to hide the composition of the Last Judgment. In doing this, they
preserved it from damage during the Revolution, and it remained so hidden
for seventy years.<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Eventually, after its existence had been entirely forgotten,
an intelligent inhabitant of the city suspected that there might be
carving beneath the plaster, and made the great discovery.</p>

<p>One glance round the interior of the church is sufficient to show that, in
spite of the loss of unity caused by the addition of a Flamboyant Gothic
Jub&eacute;, and Gothic side chapels, we have here the best of lower Burgundian
churches, modelled on Cluny, and comprising all the characteristics of the
classical Romanesque style; although the pointed arches of the bays of the
nave, and of the high vault, not quite a barrel vault, might lead some people
to suppose, wrongly, that the church is essentially Gothic. The fluted
pilasters on the piers, a feature which we shall see repeated in many a church
hereabouts, and the triforium gallery, imitated obviously from the arcade of
the Porte d'Arroux, with further fluted pillars between pierced arches, and
the cornice above, all show how persistent was the influence of the Roman
tradition. Another feature that strikes one immediately is the stunted
height of the triforium and clerestory, a fact easily accounted for when we
remember that the Burgundians of the 12th century, while they liked a
lofty first storey, had not developed the art of buttressing sufficiently well to
enable them to lift their vaults very high. Even so the settlement, in an
outward direction, above the springing of the aisle arches, is very noticeable,
and, as we have already seen, necessitated the insertion of flying buttresses
to prevent collapse within two hundred years of their erection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet, despite these drawbacks, an observer, standing in one of the transepts,
and looking across at the other transept, and down the nave, cannot but be
struck by the grandeur of the whole effect; by the lightened solidity, the
well-tempered massiveness which is characteristic of Burgundian architecture,
as it is of Burgundy as a whole.</p>

<p>I am not one of those who consider that the building art of the 12th
century, here or elsewhere, can ever rival the developed Gothic in inspiring
power, as a setting for, or as a symbol of, the mystical spirit of Christianity,
and I think that this opinion applies especially to the work of these Burgundian
architects, whose adherence to classic detail must inevitably recall,
to cultured minds, the Hellenic myths with which they are historically associated,
and carry down an architectural tradition of horizontal effect, utterly
at variance with the dominance of vertical line that was to be one of the
main characteristics of 13th century development.</p>

<p>This clashing of two styles, however, has been tempered in Autun
Cathedral by the insertion at the transepts, between the piers, of round shafts
which carry the eye up to the vault, and break the severity of the square
angles of the crossing.</p>

<p>The top of the little spiral staircase in the north transept, is the best
place from which to see the detail of the triforium arcade, the decoration of
the archivolts, and the band of roses above them. Here, too, is to be had
a good view of the domed vault.</p>

<p>The eastern end of the cathedral has no ambulatory, but is in the form
of a circular apse, with eastern chapels. In the 15th and 16th centuries
were carried out the drastic changes that have completely altered the
character of the exterior, and destroyed the unity of the cathedral. At this
time the Romanesque apse underwent considerable modifications; and, two
centuries later, further futile improvements were made. The western
towers were practically rebuilt and domed; the Last Judgment in the porch
was mutilated and covered with plaster, and&mdash;crowning feat of all&mdash;the
magnificent tomb of Lazarus, by Brother Martin, which had sheltered for
600 years the relics of Autun's patron saint, was utterly destroyed. Lastly,
these imbecile clergy of the 18th century, lined the apse, nearly up to the
walls of the comparatively new Gothic windows, with panels of red Sicilian
marble, divided by columns of grey, antique marble, and adorned them
with gilded capitals, fat cherubs, and other utterly incongruous ornaments.
It is generally believed that a portion of this marble was taken from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
tomb of Lazarus, which they used as a quarry, and the remainder from the
Roman ruins.</p>

<p>The capitals of the church,&mdash;among the best of their period existing in
France&mdash;are typically Burgundian in their animation and vigour, their richness
of detail, and their freedom of treatment, both as regards figures and
foliage. They are at too high an elevation, and not sufficiently well
lighted, to be studied thoroughly from below; but they are full of interest;
and any enthusiast who is well versed in these matters, can pass a very
pleasant hour in making more or less successful guesses at the subjects
illustrated. Here are some of them. On the south-west side: The body of
Saint Vincent guarded by Eagles; The History of Simon the Magician; The
Washing of Feet; The Martyrdom of Stephen; The Ark on Mount
Ararat; The History of Judas. On the north-east side: The Birth of the
Virgin; The Sacrifice of Isaac; Saint Joakim in the Desert; The Hebrews
in the Furnace; Daniel in the Lions' Den; Christ on the Roof of the
Temple; The Resurrection; The Visit of the Magi to Herod; The Flight
into Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The few monuments to be found in the cathedral are not of great interest.
The best are the kneeling statues which originally formed part of the
Gothic tomb of Pierre Jeannin, the famous Minister of Henry the Fourth,
and of his wife. The tomb, now destroyed, was by Nicolas Guillain, about
the year 1626; but M. de Fontenay thinks that the bust of Jeannin, much
superior to the other, dates, more probably, from the end of the 16th
century. Those who wish to know more than I can tell them of the subjects
of this monument, are referred to Mont&eacute;gut's charming book, "Souvenirs
de Bourgogne," which is well worth reading, for the aptness of its
observation, its many interesting historical and local references, its delicate
wit, and its literary style.</p>

<p>The many Gothic chapels thrown out from the aisle in the 15th and 16th
centuries, and the flamboyant jub&eacute;, are not of particular interest, and, moreover,
destroy the unity of the interior. I will, therefore, pass them by; but,
before leaving the church, I must call attention to what some people consider
to be one of its chief treasures,&mdash;the martyrdom of Saint Symphorien,
by Ingres&mdash;a painting ranked by some connoisseurs as the masterpiece of the
19th century. It was specially ordered for the cathedral in 1824, but was
not delivered until some thirty years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot pretend to any enthusiasm for the result of those thirty years
of labour. The picture leaves me absolutely cold, as it does nine out of every
ten who see it. The figures are vigorous, and the colouring is, perhaps,
more pleasing than is the case with some of Ingres' paintings&mdash;probably
because the canvas is dirty and ill-lighted&mdash;but the picture is overcrowded,
and the general effect theatrical. On the whole I am not disposed to
quarrel with the critics who regretted that ever Ingres forsook the pencil for
the brush.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Here, in a few words, is the story of Saint Symphorien which the reader
will find in full in the "Pr&eacute;cis Historique" of "Autun et ses monuments."
It appears that, in the middle of the twelfth century, the gods chiefly
favoured by the Autunois, were, Berecynthia&mdash;or Cybele&mdash;Apollo, and
Diana. One day, when the image of Berecynthia, accompanied by an enormous
crowd, was being wheeled on a cart through the streets of the city,
Symphorien, having refused to do homage to her, was arrested and brought
before the Roman magistrate, Heraclicus, to whom he boldly confessed his
Christian faith. The magistrate, unwilling to deal harshly with a patrician
youth, read to him the ante-Christian edict of Marcus Aurelius, which
decrees the capital punishment of obstinate heretics, and endeavoured, in vain,
to bring Symphorien to reason. Finally, he gave orders for the prisoner to
be beaten by the lictors, and brought before him again, after passing three
days in prison. Some of the dialogue that took place at the second interview
is worth recording as the <i>acta sincera</i> of Symphorien probably give it to us
in a nearly verbatim form, and support, in a very interesting way, the other
evidence we can produce to show that the worship of the Romans, as of
the Greeks, whose religion they honoured, was, to our way of thinking,
somewhat indecently commercial&mdash;the purchase, for value received, of the
divinity's favour. Thus the magistrate: "How much wiser you would be,
Symphorien, by sacrificing to the immortal gods, to obtain promotion in the
army, and rewards from the public treasury. If to-day you do not bend the
knee before the image of the goddess mother, if you do not practice the cult
due to Apollo and Diana, you will be put to death, and nothing can prevent
it. If you consent, I will have the altar of the gods made ready; prepare,
then, to let the smoke of the incense rise in their honour, and to render to
the divinity the rights which are his due."</p>

<p>Symphorien replied:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_050fp.jpg" width="417" height="660" alt="Autun; Fontaine St. Lazare" title="" />
  <p class="center font09"><b>FONTAINE ST LAZARE&mdash;AUTUN</b></p>
  <p class="left font08"><i>Facing page 50</i></p>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"The judge in whom is vested the public authority should not accompany
his sentence with vain and useless words. If it be perilous not to make every
day further progress in the way of perfection, how much more so to wander
from the straight path and to risk foundering upon the reefs of sin?"</p>

<p>Again the magistrate spoke:</p>

<p>"Sacrifice to the gods, that you may enjoy the honour granted by the
prince to those who serve him." Symphorien replied in the same strain.</p>

<p>"A judge degrades his authority when he thus publicly puts a price upon
the observance of the law. He does irreparable wrong to his soul, and
shames his good name for ever."</p>

<p>Finally, the official, irritated, cut short Symphorien's discourse, with the
following sentence:&mdash;"That Symphorien, guilty of public crime, in having
committed sacrilege by refusing to sacrifice to the gods, and seeking to profane
our holy altars, should be struck by the avenging sword, that the dread
effects of his crime may be cancelled, and the law, human and divine,
satisfied."</p>

<p>In Ingres' picture, Symphorien is on his way to execution outside the town
walls, while, from the rampart, his mother is addressing to him her last words
of farewell and encouragement. He was decapitated by the executioner, and
his body buried at night near a fountain "extra publicum campum," probably
one of the vast burial places on the road to Langres and Besan&ccedil;on.<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Here we leave the cathedral of Autun, comforting ourselves with the
assurance that, though we pass no more beneath its magnificent porch, we shall
meet sister churches, not less beautiful, in other ancient towns of Burgundy.
Meanwhile, before descending the steep old street that leads downwards,
by the Hotel Rolin, to the centre of modern Autun, wander awhile through
the narrow ways of the cathedral precincts, where still, as of old, the priests,
living relics of a shadowy past, muttering into their breviaries, pace up and
down before many a curious Gothic building.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century&mdash;1543, to be precise&mdash;the chapter of the cathedral
commissioned an architect unknown, who may possibly have been Jean
Goujon, to erect a fountain which was placed, at first, near the corner of the
Place St. Louis and the Place des Terraces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1784, it was decided that the
fountain obstructed the road; and it was accordingly removed to its present
site, where it remains, after many moving accidents and adventures, and in
spite of alterations, a gem of the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> No description can convey
an idea of the harmonious and decorative effect of this little fountain, unmatched
for felicity in all France. The design is in two superposed pierced
lanterns, the lower one surrounded by a cupola, and containing a basin below.
The Ionic columns, the pilasters, the vases surmounting the entablature, and
the pelican crowning the whole, are all perfectly proportioned and harmonized;
and enough is left of the original sculpture to show how exquisite in
every detail was the execution of the original work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_052.jpg" width="620" height="416" alt="Autun; Tour des Ursulines" title="" />
</div>

<p>Just below the fountain, in the Rue des Bancs, is the Hotel Rolin, the
most interesting of the many museums with which Autun is favoured.
Personally, I must confess to a very lukewarm enthusiasm for the majority
of provincial museums; and I am inclined to wish that Autun had collected
its relics in one good building, instead of having them in various quarters of
the town; but the Hotel Rolin is well worth a visit for its own sake. It is
the annexe of the ancient palace of the Rolins, the <i>magna domum Johannis
Rolini</i>, which faced the church of Notre Dame on the site of the Place St.
Louis; and was built by Guillaume de Beauchamp, son of Nicholas Rolin,
the famous chancellor of Burgundy, to accommodate the numerous members
of the suite of that august personage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The courtyard and the glimpse it
gives of the Hotel, when you have emerged from the darkness of the gate,
is quite characteristic of its period, though, if nature should have imparted
to you the least degree of timidity, where animals are concerned, you will
probably leave that courtyard without regret, owing to the attentions of the
concierge's very strenuous dog, who will make frantic and disconcerting
endeavours to break out upon you through a frail, ground-floor window,
which alone stands between you and a violent death. But all travellers must
be prepared to face danger, and Cerberus at the gate will enhance your
appreciation of the home of the Eduen Society.</p>

<p>The building contains some stele from the Roman burial grounds, and
numerous interesting relics, collected, for the most part, by M. Bulliot, from
the Oppidum Bibracte. It has also some good recumbent medi&aelig;val statues,
Guillaume de Brasey, 1302, Jehan de Brasey, 1305, and the Sire de
Rousillon, of the end of the thirteenth century. There is a relic of Charles
le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire, from Granson, and good portraits of Nicholas Rolin and his
brother.</p>

<p>Just below the Hotel Rolin are the remains of the old tower of the Porte
des Bancs, of the fifth century, part of the rampart surrounding the Castrum,
or upper city of Autun.<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The museum which ranks next in interest to the Hotel Rolin, is the
Mus&eacute;e Lapidaire in the Rue St. Nicholas, in the Marchaux, the lower part
of the town. It is housed in a nice little Romanesque chapel of the twelfth
century, once attached to the H&ocirc;pital St. Nicholas et St. Eloi de Marchaux.
I found the bell at the entrance broken, and had to apply for admission at the
concierge's cottage, No. 10, on the right. Knowing what I do of French
provincial museums, I have little doubt that the reader will find the bell in
the same condition. But let him not be deterred. The building, a charming
and typical example of Burgundian Romanesque, on a small scale, is
worth seeing. Its walls still show the remains of some faded frescoes,
probably, thinks M. Fontenay, of late twelfth century, representing Christ in glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The chapel is filled with odds and ends of different periods; of the
most important of which, the statues of Martha and Mary, from the cathedral,
we have already spoken. In addition to these, there is, in the apse, a
good Renaissance vierge from Autun, treated in a manner that contrasts very
thoroughly with the saints on the wall behind her. The Renaissance
remains from the chapel of Denis Poillot, ambassador of Francis I. in
England, are of the highest order of merit, and make one regret much that
the building has not survived. On the floor is a fine Roman mosaic, now
covered with a cloth, and, close to it, a well-executed Roman sarcophagus,
from Arles, representing the chase of the wild-boar of Calydon. The
realistic sculpture is typical of much that is still to be seen in the most
interesting Mus&eacute;e Lapidaire of that provincial town.</p>

<p>Beside the chapel is a pleasant little garden, surrounded by an open shed
which houses numberless relics of Roman and early Christian Autun,
chiefly stele, tombstones, fragments of mosaic, etc. Historically the most
interesting are the d&eacute;bris of the grey marble sarcophagus that once contained
the body of Queen Brunehault, one of the most energetic and clear-sighted
personalities of Merovingian times. In the name of her grandson, Thierry,
she governed Burgundy for fifteen years (598-613), establishing her court at
Autun, and, although more than sixty years of age, showed a "sagacity in
council and administrative ability" which is noted by Gregory of Tours.
Finally, some of the Burgundian chiefs, who hated her, delivered her over
to her enemy, King Clotaire II. He caused her to be paraded for three days
on a camel's back, in sight of all the army, and then had her tied by her hair,
and by one foot and arm, to the tail of a wild horse, which was then driven
far away. Her remains, buried in the Abbey of St. Martin, at Autun, not
far from the chapel of St. Nicholas, were discovered there in 1632, in a
leaden coffin, which contained, also, among other objects, a spur, said to be
that which was used upon the horse to which the Queen was bound.</p>

<p>There are worse places to wander in, and to dream in, than these open
galleries, where the silent ones stand, side by side, upon their funeral stones,
and the chickens scratch among Roman capitals. The gardienne's children
are at play on the path, and, in the centre of the green cloister garth, the
ripening pears tremble upon the swaying branches. The old caretaker&mdash;blessed
among caretakers&mdash;leaves you alone, until you summon her. She is
ready for a chat, but can impart no information whatever concerning the
monuments in her charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye, Madame; and when I come again, in the spring, I shall
expect to find the bell mended." "Parfaitement, Monsieur; Ha! ha! ha!"
and her gossip friend, across the road, joins in the chorus, "Ha! ha! ha!
Ha! ha! ha!" But the bell will not be mended&mdash;and they know it.</p>

<p>The Mus&eacute;e municipal in the Hotel de Ville&mdash;the last mus&eacute;e which I shall
inflict upon the reader&mdash;is as dreary as a haunted house, and much less
interesting. You wander through gallery after gallery of second and third
rate paintings, to be rewarded, at last, in the end room, by two little bronze
crupellaires, or fighting gladiators of the first century, so called because,
according to Tacitus, they were completely hidden beneath an iron armour,
so thick as to make the wearer as immune against blows as he was incapable
of dealing them.<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The most interesting thing in the museum is the famous
Greek inscription which has excited the interest of antiquarians and theologians
all over the world. The stone is a piece of white marble, broken
into fragments which are pieced together again, and on which is a Greek
acrostic, and something supposed to stand for a Sigma. The inscription,
believed to be of the third or fourth century, is as follows. The translation
I give is from the French, as quoted by Hamerton in "The Mount."</p>

<p>"O divine race of heavenly &#921;&#967;&#952;&#965;&#962;, receive with a heart full of respect
life immortal among the mortals. Renew thy soul's youth, O my friend!
in the divine waters, by the eternal waves of wisdom that flow from the true
riches. Receive the delicious food of the Saviour of saints. Take, eat and
drink, thou holdest &#921;&#967;&#952;&#965;&#962; in thy hands. &#921;&#967;&#952;&#965;&#962; grant me this grace,
ardently I desire it, Master and Saviour; may my mother rest in peace, I
conjure thee, light of the dead. Aschandeus, my father, thou whom I
cherish, with my tender mother and all my relations in the peace of &#921;&#967;&#952;&#965;&#962;.
remember thy Pectorius."<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Hotel de Ville in which the Mus&eacute;e Municipal is housed, fronts upon
the Champ de Mars, formerly the Champ St. Ladre (campus sancti Lazari)
the centre of the life of the town. It was built over in Roman times, as
proved by the substructures that have been found, but the land was cleared
about the twelfth century. Throughout all the middle ages its convenient
position between the Castrum and the Marchaux rendered it a kind of forum,
or general public meeting place, and the site of the great f&ecirc;tes and fairs.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>During the visit of Charles VIII. to Autun, in 1516, the inhabitants constructed
in St. Ladre an immense wooden amphitheatre, with a linen velarium
as a protection, quite in the old Roman manner. Here, too, from time immemorial,
has been held, and is still held, in September, the great f&ecirc;te de St.
Ladre, and cattle fair that draws so many traders to Autun, and destroys
for a month the peace of the cathedral city.<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The wars of religion and
the great revolution have brought their quota of victims to the stake, the
gallows, or the guillotine, that in turn were set up in the centre of the place.
At the north-east corner, opposite the Hotel de Ville, are the best caf&eacute;s of
the town, where, I remember, we learned the latest news of the Portuguese
Revolution.</p>

<p>Just round the corner, in the Rue de l'Arbal&egrave;te, is the best Hotel
of Autun, "St. Louis et de la Poste," a great rambling building of the
early seventeenth century, that, in itself, is a lasting souvenir of great historical
events. On the 10th of January, 1802, Napoleon Buonaparte passed
through Autun on the way to Lyons. He stayed one night, with the
Empress Josephine, at the Hotel St. Louis, where he received the local
authorities. Several ladies of the town, eager for a sight of the great man,
obtained the hotelier's permission to officiate as waitresses, for that night
only. Josephine discovered the ruse at once, and was so amused thereby that
she proceeded to play her part in the game with the utmost grace and charm.</p>

<p>The hundred days saw Napoleon again at the Hotel St. Louis. He had
left Elba on the 26th February, 1815, and arrived at Autun on the 15th of
March. According to the account of an eye witness<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the troops accompanying
him were utterly exhausted, and could keep no sort of order; their ranks
were broken, and soldiers of all arms were marching pell-mell. Napoleon
was surprised and deeply hurt by his reception at Autun. No crowds came
out to meet him, and scarcely a cry of "Vive l'Empereur" was heard. The
houses were shut, the streets deserted, and only a small company of nobodies,
in blouses and sabots, formed his cort&egrave;ge.... No sooner had
he descended at the Hotel de la Poste, than he asked for the mayor and the
municipal council. They were brought into a balconied room looking on
the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor, attended by Marshal Bertrand, General Brayer,
and five or six other military men, appeared to be in a state of great agitation.
He was pacing up and down, holding in his hand the proclamation of the
night before, stepping at every moment on to the balcony, and leaving it
with angry looks. When all had entered he stood in the middle of the
apartment, and asked which was the mayor of Autun.</p>

<p>"I am," said M. Piquot.</p>

<p>"I know what you are," the Emperor replied, "a man always ready to
pay court to nobles; one who would sacrifice his dignity for a dinner. You
are mayor no longer; only a fanatic and a madman could have drawn up
such an act as this. You dare to treat me as an usurper!"</p>

<p>"Sire," said M. de la Chaise, president of the civil tribunal, "by your
abdication you have freed us from our oaths, and we have sworn fealty to
Louis XVIII."</p>

<p>"I have abdicated, you say. I did it only to assure the happiness of the
French. France is not happy. She recalls me, and you would oppose her....
Madman! you would have civil war, then!"</p>

<p>"But, enfin, sire, you have abdicated."</p>

<p>"Be silent!" cried Napoleon, angrily, "you are only a wretched attorney."</p>

<p>We need not follow any further a quarrel which led nowhere. Amid the
same cold silence that had marked his arrival, Napoleon left early the next
morning, to face the last triumphs and the crushing disaster of those fateful
hundred days.<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Another visitor to the Hotel St. Louis was George Sand, who came in
the midst of all the bustle and excitement of the fair of St. Ladre, on the
2nd September, 1836, and was served, with two children and a nurse, under
a fruit tree in the garden into which the guests had overflowed. She must
have overheard, at the large table, words which offended her, for, says St.
Fonteney, she left her repast and the hotel in haste, and, two months afterwards,
took a full revenge in the columns of the "Revue des deux Mondes,"
in which she referred darkly to the occasion as an "obscenity" and an "orgie
of patricians." One would hardly have thought George Sand so squeamish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>We, too, being only passers by, must leave Autun in haste. The autumn
sun was setting, and the ruby mists of evening were creeping up the purple
slopes of the Morvan, as the train steamed out of the station. Our compartment
was quite unlit, and gradually, as night fell, darkness enwrapped
us so completely that we could not so much as see a hand held before the
face. When we drew up at Epinac, a bent old woman, standing huddled up
on the platform, peered into the compartment, in a futile endeavour to see
what it might contain. She called the guard. They both looked in. "Fait
ben noir" (very dark), she muttered. He shrugged his shoulders. The
old woman wandered off vacantly. Third class fare on a monopoly railway
does not entitle you to light; and she knew it. Along the darkened train
ran a legend that they were buying oil and wick in the town. We waited,
waited, long enough for them to have bought up the whole town and the
one beyond it. But no light came, until, southward, I saw a faint, silvery
glimmer. Then I knew what we were waiting for. There is no charge
for moonlight&mdash;not even on that railway. But it was still dark as pitch.
With a jerk the train began to move out; a large parcel, the property of a
young French girl in front of me, fell down upon the head of her small and
sleepy nephew, Madelon, who howled plaintively. The soldier in the
corner, compelled by the presence of ladies to refrain, for an hour past, from
indulging in his ruling passion, could contain himself no longer. He spat
voluminously, vociferously, like a hen clucking. Almost as loudly Madelon
sucked at a lozenge bestowed for the soothing of the bruised head. As the
moon rose, the darkness paled. I could just see Madelon regarding complacently
the lozenge that he had removed from his mouth.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Madelon, Madelon, how many times have I told you not to take things
from your mouth when you are eating? Once in, they must stay in.
Veux tu m'ob&eacute;ir." The rich sucking noise ceased, to be followed by the
light breathing of a child asleep. We stopped at another station. Not content
with the moon, people put their heads out of the windows, and
clamoured for light. They chaffed the station-master; they ragged the
guard. Like rabbits the men ran up and down over the roofs of the carriages.
Five porters gathered in a little woe-begone group, and looked on
vacantly. But no light came. A tin trumpet blew, and the train started.
An hour later we were climbing the hills of the C&ocirc;te d'Or and dropping
down into the eastern plain. That is how we left Autun.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The loitering train, that, climbing, winds among the vine-clad slopes of
the M&acirc;connais, gave us our first glimpse of the vendangeurs gathering the
last of a scanty crop. Those blue shirts, moving through the bronze-clad
bushes, were our first intimation that the Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire had escaped the
utter ruin that the winds and rains of a wintry summer had wrought among
the vines of the C&ocirc;te d'Or. But this incident did not impress us as it might
have done at another time or in another place. Our thoughts were not with
the wine-harvest; they were ahead, busy with the memories the name of
Cluny evokes.</p>

<p>To one who cares for what was best in the middle ages, no place in
France, no place in Europe, unless, perhaps, it be Citeaux, can exercise an
equal charm. But, as we shall see, though Citeaux rivalled, and ultimately
eclipsed Cluny in power, and, through the influence of St. Bernard, outshone
her, not in material splendour, but by the dazzling whiteness of her
purity, the historic interest of the site of the Cistercian house, there, by the
deserted woods and wind-ruffled pools of the eastern plain, could not survive,
in the minds of many, the destruction of the ancient monastery.
Cluny, the Mother Abbey of Europe, the school of popes, holds first place,
by right of birth, by right of what she was, and is. For Cluny still stands.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
The little town nestling upon the lower slopes of the valley, through which
the Grosne winds between her poplars, is not merely built upon the site of
the Abbey. It is the Abbey.</p>

<p>From the moment, when, on the way from the station, you see the ancient
towers raising, one by one, their hoary heads above the roofs, as they have
raised her past from oblivion, till, having climbed the cobble-stoned street that
winds upwards through the town, you look down through the ruined gateway
that once gave passage to kings and abbots, from every street corner, from
every church, and dwelling-house, Cluny calls to you out of the past.</p>

<p>We did not hear her at first; and we were disappointed. The Grande
Rue, by which you enter the town from the east, is so narrow, that it affords
no glimpse of what lies on either hand; and it was with unexpected
suddenness, that, turning to the right, after a few minutes of wandering, we
stood before the Hotel de Bourgogne, and looked up from the little, white
building, at the great, grey, octagonal tower and the wall of masonry, that,
we knew, must be the last survival of the Abbey Church itself. At that
moment we were standing on the site of the nave; but we did not know it.
It takes time to orient oneself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Following upon the Gallo-Roman and early Christian periods, centred
in the Autunois, the story of the rise of Cluny from humble beginnings to
her apothegm of spiritual and temporal power marks the second notable
period of Burgundian history. From this source, also, was to flow the main
stream of progress, religious and artistic, that culminated in the medi&aelig;val
triumphs of thirteenth-century European civilization. At the time of the
rise of Cluny, Burgundy, under the capetian dukes, was already established
as a vassal province of France, but the inwardness of Burgundian history&mdash;of
French history, indeed, in the 11th and 12th centuries&mdash;will be understood
only by those who realize that, until the advent of the semi-royal dukes of
the house of Valois, in 1364, the controlling forces of the duchy are to be
sought, not in Dijon, nor in Auxerre, but here, in this the mother abbey of
Western Europe.<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 909, the veteran Duke William of Aquitaine, haunted by the
shades of the many warriors who had fallen in the service of his ambition,
or troubled by the whispers of conscience, or moved, perhaps, by that not
wholly disinterested piety which sometimes awakens with the approach of
death, decided to follow the course then usual in such cases, and to found a
monastery. For this purpose, he took into his confidence his friend, Bernon,
Abbot of Gigny, who, accompanied by Hugues, Abbot of St. Martin at
Autun, paid a visit to the Duke in his villa of Cluny, and was bidden to
search out a place meet for the service of God. But the monk, gifted with
a keen eye for all the amenities of a monastic site, could find none more fitting
than this "in a spot withdrawn from all human society, so full of solitude,
of repose and of peace, that it seemed in some sort a picture (image)
of the heavenly solitude."<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The Duke, however, stung by a last pang of
regret for the loss of his lovely valley, had objections to raise. The spot was
not suitable; for, all day long, the shouts of huntsmen and the baying of
hounds broke the silence of the neighbouring forest.</p>

<p>"Drive the dogs away," said Bernon, with a laugh, "and replace them
with monks; for you well know which shall stand you best before God,
the bay of the hounds, or the monks' prayers."</p>

<p>"Surely, Father," replied the Duke, "your advice is sound, and since you
give it unfeignedly, be it done, with Christ's aid, as thy goodness bids me
do."</p>

<p class="pmb1">In the year 909, the 11th year of Charles the Simple, the old Duke, lest,
at his last hour, he should deserve the reproach of having thought only of the
care of his body, and of the augmentation of his earthly possessions, wrote in
his will, as follows:&mdash;"I declare that, for the love of God and of our
Saviour, Jesus Christ, I give and bequeath to the holy apostles, Peter and
Paul, all that I possess at Cluny ... without excepting anything
dependent upon my domain of Cluny (Villa), farms, oratories, slaves of
both sexes, vines, meadows, fields, water, water-courses, mills, rights of
way, lands, cultivated or uncultivated,
without any reserve."<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_062.jpg" width="615" height="421" alt="Cluny; Valley of the Grosne and part of the Abbey Grounds" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He gives
this, he goes on to say, for the good of soul and body of himself, his wife,
his relatives, and dependents, "on condition that a monastery shall be built at
Cluny, in honour of the apostles, Peter and Paul, and that there shall
gather monks, living according to the rule of St. Benedict<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> to hold and
administer for ever the things given, so that this house may become the
true house of prayer, that it may be filled for ever with faithful vows and
pious supplications, that here shall be desired and besought, with ardent
wish and earnest longing, the wonders of communion with Heaven, that
prayers and supplications be addressed without ceasing to God, both for
me and for those persons of whom I have already made mention."</p>

<p>Further:&mdash;"By God, in God and all His Saints, and under the fearful
menace of the last judgment, I beg, I beseech, that no secular prince, nor
count, nor bishop, nor the Pontiff himself of the Roman Church, do invade
the possessions of God's servants, nor sell nor diminish, nor give in benefice
to whomsoever it may be, anything to them belonging, nor allow any head
to be set over them against their will. And that this prohibition may be
more strongly binding upon the wicked and the headstrong, I insist and I
add, and I conjure you, Oh! Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and Thou,
Pontiff of the Pontiffs of the apostolic seat, to cut off from communion
with the Holy Church and from life eternal, by the canonical authority
thou has received of God, all robbers, invaders, or sellers of that which I
give, of my full satisfaction and of my evident will."</p>

<p>Sometimes, reading the old Duke's powerful anathema, that tells us more
of the spirit of the time in which he lived than could any long narration of
facts, I wonder, as I think of the after history of Cluny, whether that awful
curse may not have alighted, or may not alight hereafter, upon the souls of
those who have violated the conditions of its grant, or in blind fury have laid
impious hands upon the hallowed stones of its church.</p>

<p>Here, then, in the solitary valley of the Grosne, on the slope of a hill
forming one of a range which marks the northern extremity of the Cevennes,
was planted the tree whose branches were to over-shadow Europe. The
site was well chosen for the birthplace of such a destiny.</p>

<p>Occupying a middle position between Gothic and Latin influences, Cluny
could here best fulfil her mission, which, indeed, has been and is still, in
some sort, the mission of Burgundy, that of reconciling the conflicting, and
often bitterly antagonistic, elements of north and south. Situated within a
few kilometres of the Roman Road of Agrippa, which, passing Clermain and
St. C&eacute;cile, connected Lyons and Boulogne, by way of M&acirc;con and Autun,
the Abbey was also connected with Italy by that magnificent waterway, the
Sa&ocirc;ne and the Rh&ocirc;ne. Travellers could come by land or by river to Cluny.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early years of the monastery, few came. Faith had weakened
throughout all the land, and in many houses the monks of Gaul had departed
from the strict rule of St. Benedict. It was the mission of Odon, the
first of the long line of great and saintly abbotts, to be a reformer of that
rule, and, by the example of his holy life, to augment the numbers, and increase
the prosperity of the Abbey. From his earliest years, while yet he
was in the monastery of Balme, says his
chronicler, Jean de Salerne, his merits,
becoming known throughout all the district,
were finding expression in the
gracious legends of the time. One of
the best known was the miracle of the
crumbs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 230px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_064.jpg" width="230" height="367" alt="Cluny; Tour Fabri" title="" />
</div>

<p>An article of the rule bade the monks
gather carefully the crumbs of bread
from the table, and eat them before the
end of the meal. When the signal to
rise had been given, it was forbidden to
lift any more food to the mouth. Odon,
intent, one day, upon the lesson that was
being read aloud in the refectory, forgot
the crumbs. Not daring either to eat
them, or to leave them on the table, he
kept them in his hand, while he and his
companions left the refectory and went
into the church where grace was sung.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, Odon
threw himself at the feet of the father,
and asked forgiveness; but, when he opened his hand to show him the crumbs,
behold, to the astonishment of the brothers, each crumb was a precious pearl!
By the order of Bernon, the stones were fastened to one of the ornaments
of the church.<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Under such heavenly guidance, even the very beasts of the forest
ministered to the growing community. When Odon had completed the
early church, which Jean de Salerne modestly speaks of as an oratory and
chapel, replaced, a century later, by a larger one, the bishop came to consecrate
the building. Forgetting the poverty of the monks, he brought with
him such a lordly retinue of attendants and servants, that the abbot was
sorely troubled as to how his guests were to be worthily received, and suitably
fed. On the day of the ceremony, when the grey dawn had driven westward
the shadows of the night, a great wild boar emerged from the neighbouring
forest, and ran, at full speed, to the monastery. The guardian of
the church, who was busy adorning the exterior porch, struck with terror at
the sight, retreated hastily, shut the door behind him, and drew the bolts.
But the fierce animal, fierce no longer, began to lick the door&mdash;leaving upon
it marks of white foam&mdash;and to tap gently with its hoof, as though to beg
admittance. But all who saw the beast, fled, until, weary with much
knocking, it lay down across the threshold. When the bishop and his suite
arrived, a cry of terror rose from the company. They aroused the neighbours,
who came, armed with sticks. But the boar, instead of shewing fight,
offered himself voluntarily to death, and his flesh, prepared with all the art
of the monastic cooks, satisfied the refined tastes of the prelates.</p>

<p>Every day Cluny grew in grace, in wisdom, in numbers, in riches, in
influence, in power civil and spiritual. One after one, she founded new
monasteries, and reformed those already in existence, until, under Odilon,
in the beginning of the 11th century, a cluster of priories had been built upon
lands ceded to the abbey, and Cluny was attaining an importance greater than
any other order had acquired until that day. In the plains, upon the summits
of the hills, by the banks of river and stream, in the depths of the
forests, in the solitude of the valley, even in remote and silent places, were
springing up little communities of monks, whose clocher, was, for the
peasants, a symbol of charity, of refuge, of God come down among men;<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and every year, nobles, not a few, gave lands in the neighbouring comt&eacute;s to
the Abbey of Cluny.</p>

<p>The great fervour with which the monastic revival was received, had been
due, in part, to the awful miseries of France during the 10th
century, and in part to an almost universal belief that the year 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
would herald the second coming of Christ, and the end of the world;
but, by the time that year had passed without the advent of any of the
expected phenomena, the more clear-sighted, perceiving the immense possibilities
which the religious revival shadowed forth, for the welfare of a people
crushed beneath the harsh feudal laws of the time, saw therein an additional
inducement to encourage monastic effort. Gratitude for preservation had
also its effect. All omens were propitious for the rise of Cluny to great
glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1024, a lady of noble Burgundian family, knowing that the
hour was come in which she should give birth to a child, and following the
custom of the time, summoned a priest, who, by the sacrifice of the mass,
should assure her a happy delivery. At the moment when, while consecrating
the host, he was wrapt in fervent prayer, there appeared to him, shaping
itself upon the golden bottom of the cup, a child's face radiant with a
heavenly light. At the conclusion of the ceremony, he hastened to tell the
mother what he had seen, and, finding the child already born, predicted that,
God granting him life, the boy was chosen out for a great destiny, and
would surely be found worthy, one day, to minister the cup in which his
birth had been thus signalized. To the great joy of the mother, that hope
was gloriously fulfilled; for the son born under such happy omens was
Hugues, the greatest of the great abbots of Cluny, he, under whom the
abbey, and, indeed, the whole church of Rome, was to establish an authority
never before dreamed of in Christendom.</p>

<p>Braving the anger of his father, Delmace, an ambitious and violent
Seigneur, who would fain have seen his son don the knight's armour rather
than the monk's cowl, Hugues, already ardently set upon a life of piety,
obtained admission to the monastery of St. Marcel de Chalon, which he soon
left, in order to place himself under the protection of Odilon, the then
abbott of Cluny. This new father of the young Hugues was one of the best
beloved of the abbotts of that monastery. Lacking the austerity of his predecessor,
Odon&mdash;the great reformer whose energies had given new life to the
Benedictine order&mdash;Saint Odilon, this "dernier et le plus m&eacute;prisable des
fr&egrave;res de Cluny," as he styled himself, though short and thin in person, was,
at the same time, robust and virile; a humble, grave, sympathetic, fatherly
man, whose pale face could flush with anger, and his gentle voice become
terrible in rebuke of wrong-doing; one whom the sins and sorrows of the
living and the dead<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> touched to the heart, as attested by the many healings
with which legend has credited his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the man, already abbot
for more than forty years, under whose worthy protection young Hugues
placed himself. The new-comer, elected abbot on the death of Odilon in
1048, soon showed himself to be of yet sterner stuff even than his predecessor.
Humble as regards his personal pretensions, kind and charitable to the poor
and needy, he had, nevertheless, an eye which could read in their faces the
souls of men; and he was fired with a holy ambition for the glory of the
church.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_067.jpg" width="210" height="202" alt="Clunisian Ornament" title="" />
</div>

<p>In bringing about the realization of these dreams, he found a worthy ally
in that Napoleon of the Church, Hildebrand (Gregory VII.), one of the four
monks, who, from a cell at Cluny, passed to the throne of St. Peter.<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> We
need not here deal at length with that long
struggle&mdash;the most significant event of the
eleventh century&mdash;between the civil and
religious rules of Christendom, in which
Gregory succeeded in enforcing, if only for
a time, the most tremendous and all-embracing
claims that the church has ever advanced;
but I shall be excused for recalling again that
extraordinary scene enacted, in 1076, on the
castled summit of the craggy Apennine hills,
the rock of Alba Canossa, where the
representative of temporal power, Henry
IV., King of the Germans, attired in a penitent's garb of coarse wool,
waited barefoot, through three bitter winter's days, in the courtyard
of the castle, upon the pleasure of God's vice-regent on earth. Hugh,
then Abbot of Cluny, was present at that scene; and it was largely owing
to his mediation, backed by the influence of the Countess Matilda, that
Henry was at last admitted to the royal presence.<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Remembering how brief
was Gregory's pontificate&mdash;a span of ten years&mdash;and his bitter last words at
Palermo: "I have loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore I die in exile,"
it may appear to some readers that the triumph of this little, ill-shaped
homuncio was short-lived; but we have to remember that, as Bishop Mathew
has pointed out, his influence upon succeeding generations was greater than
upon his own, and that without Gregory VII. there would have been no
Innocent III. to become, in effect, "the king of kings, lord of lords, the only
ruler of princes" in all Christendom.</p>

<p>In many sublime and dramatic scenes, then being enacted throughout
Europe, Hugues was called upon to play the part of peacemaker, but in none
was his task more difficult than in that struggle between Gregory and Henry,
to whom he was equally bound by ties of close friendship. That he remained
on good, even on intimate terms, with both men, is strong testimony to his
integrity of character. More than once, in later years, he allayed the storms
that Gregory was raising; he defended Henry IV. against the ingratitude of
his son; and it is to Hugues that we find the dethroned and fugitive emperor
turning for consolation and advice concerning that revolt.<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In such hands, at such a time, the glories of Cluny were safe. Nor was
the papacy unmindful of all it owed to the great abbey. Here is Gregory's
own eulogy of Cluny, delivered before the Council of Rome, in 1077.
"Among all those situate beyond the hills, shines in the first rank that of
Cluny under the protection of the holy seat. Under its holy abbots, it has
reached so high a degree of honour and of religion, that, by the fervour with
which God is there served, it surpasses undeniably all other monasteries, not
excepting even the most ancient; so that none other in this part of the Christian
world may be compared with it. To this day, all her abbots have been
raised to the honour of sainthood. Not one among them, not one of their
monks, obedient sons of the Romish Church, has fallen away nor bowed the
knee to Baal; but, faithful always to the dignity and liberty granted to them
by the Church from the foundation of the monastery, they have nobly upheld
its authority, and will submit to no other power than that of St.
Peter."<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The privileges of Cluny became the ideal type for all others, and
Gregory always regarded a comparison with the Burgundian abbey as a peculiar
sign of favour, as in the case of St. Victor of Marseilles, whose monks he
wished to console for the loss of a beloved abbot.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Not unnaturally, an institution so growing in grace, power, and riches,
was growing also in numbers. The new monks must be housed; God must
be honoured in, and by, a nobler Church. Nor was the Deity long in
making known His will.</p>

<p>One night, a monk of Cluny, sick and paralytic, was asleep in bed, when
he saw appear before him the Apostles, Peter and Paul, and Stephen, the first
Martyr. The monk asked them who they were, and what their will might
be. Then St. Peter spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am St. Peter, and these are St. Paul and St. Stephen. Rise, without
delay, brother, and bear our orders to Hugues, Abbot of this Church. It
pains us to see so many brothers gathered into so small a space, and our wish
is that the Abbot should build a greater. And let him not consider the cost;
we shall know how to provide all things necessary for the work."</p>

<p>"I dare not take it upon me to bear your orders," replied the monk.
"For no heed would be given to my words."</p>

<p>"You have been chosen before all others," said St. Peter, "to transmit our
commands to Hugues, so that your miraculous healing may gain credence
for your message. If you obey faithfully, seven years shall be added to your
life, and if Hugues defers the execution of our will, the sickness, upon leaving
you, shall pass into his body."</p>

<p>So speaking, St. Peter proceeded to measure out with cords the length,
breadth, and height of the new building; then, showing the monk its proportions,
the style, the necessary ornament, and the nature of the materials to be
used, he counselled him to keep all these things faithfully in his memory.</p>

<p>The monk, for whose funeral the bell-ringers were already awaiting the
summons, awakened with a start, ran, safe and sound, to the Abbot's room,
and told him the whole story. This midnight appearance of a man, dying
an hour ago, and now healed by a marvellous vision, greatly astonished the
good Abbot. Threatened with his brother's sickness, if he postponed the
commencement of the building, and encouraged, moreover, by the heavenly
aid promised to the enterprise, he believed, obeyed, and, with God's help,
raised, in twenty years, a temple that was the glory of its age, and remained,
for centuries, one of the marvels of Western Europe.<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition adds, that Hugues, not knowing exactly where to build the
Church, threw a hammer into the air, and chose the spot where it fell for the
site of his sanctuary. In after years, before the abbey buildings were mutilated,
the inhabitants would still show, near one of them, an enormous stone
that all the workmen and all their machines were unable to lift. St. Hugues
only, during the night, by Divine help, could raise the huge mass, and place
it in position; and ever after the stone retained the imprint of the Holy
Founder's hand.</p>

</div>

<p>Often the workmen, as they built the walls of the Church, would notice,
watching them unweariedly, working
silently in their midst, but sharing never
in their repasts, a mysterious and wonderful
figure. Some said that he was an
angel presiding over the erection of the
House of God; some said that he was
none other than St. Hugues himself.</p>

<p>It was in 1095 that Pascal II., crossing
Provence by way of Tarascon and Avignon,
arrived at Cluny, in the month of
November, accompanied by a large suite
of cardinals, bishops, and priests. Everywhere
he was received with transports of
joy; for no living man had yet seen the
Vicar of Christ in this part of the land of
Burgundy. At the request of Hugues, he
had come to consecrate the great altar of
the unfinished basilica. This he did, and
also superintended the consecration, by
attendant archbishops, of the other altars
in the transept. In the midst of these
ceremonies, turning to the crowd of on-lookers
who had surrounded the building
on all sides, Pascal reminded them of the
special privileges with which the monastery
had been endowed, of his own connection
with it as monk under the same
Abbot, who still, by God's mercy, was alive and well in their midst; then,
in the name of God, and by the holy memories he had awakened, he implored
all to uphold and respect the sanctity of the new abbey-church.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until 1131 that the great basilica, completed at last, was consecrated
by Innocent II., amid scenes similar to those that had attended the
visit of Urban II.</p>

<p>Whether the building was inspired of God, or was merely a successful
exercise of a fast-developing art, the new Cluny was not unworthy of the
great order for which it stood. Not only was it, with the exception of St.
Peter's at Rome, the largest Church in existence,<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> but it remained also one
of the most perfect examples of the Romanesque architecture, and became
the accepted model for many a later Burgundian church and cathedral. The
architect, according to Pignot, was a former canon of Li&egrave;ge, named
Etzebon; artist, orator, theologian, and author of the life of St. Hugues. He
appears to have had no difficulty in acquiring the first necessity of his work,
namely, funds. Kings, nobles, and bishops vied with one another in their
eagerness to make offerings to the new Church; the neighbouring princes
made handsome donations, the pious of all classes brought gifts, offered voluntary
labour, or the loan of beasts of burden. The two lordliest givers were
Alonzo VI., King of Castille, and Henry I. of England, the former of whom
was deeply indebted to Hugues, whose influence with his kinsman, Eudes,
Duke of Burgundy, had often smoothed Alonzo's path. The Abbot, in
recognition "of the incessant benefits of this faithful friend," founded, on
his behalf, almsgivings and special prayers throughout the order, and every
day served, at the chief table, as though the King were present, a royal
dinner, which was afterwards distributed among the poor.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Meanwhile, as the gifts poured in, the building grew. From the great
double gates,<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Roman in style, and imitated, probably, from the Porte
d'Arroux, at Autun, the land sloped downwards to the parvis, from the
midst of which rose a great stone cross. Thence flights of balustraded steps,
broken, at intervals, by terraced platforms, led down to the porch, flanked
on each side by square towers, the Tour de la Justice, and Tour des
Archives, each a hundred and forty feet high, and crowned with a pyramidal
fl&ecirc;che. This porch, ornamented with statues of the saints and the Virgin,
was surmounted, in the space between the towers, by a great rose, thirty feet
in diameter, with the figure of a Benedictine monk above.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_072.jpg" width="620" height="409" alt="Cluny Abbey, as it was at the beginning of XIXth Century" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It opened into a
magnificent church of five bays, one hundred and ten feet long, and one
hundred and eighteen feet high, the narthex of the great basilica.<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It was
divided into a nave and two aisles, the whole supported by enormous square
pillars, their sides decorated with fluted pilasters, which also helped to carry
the pointed arches of the bays. From the capitals of the pilasters, clusters of
four shafts rose to the level of a frieze, just above the tops of the arches, from
which other columns carried the high vault. A cornice supported on consoles
separated the clerestory from the triforium arcade of four round-headed
arches, enclosed in pairs under a larger arch. Cornices, friezes, and capitals
were decorated with flowers, birds, figures, and grotesque animals in the
Clunisian style. Many a pilgrim visitor, standing in this great church,
nearly as large as the Church of Notre Dame de Dijon, believed himself to
be in the basilica itself, never dreaming that this was but the porch or ante-nave.</p>

<p>Many theories have been advanced as to the purpose of this narthex,
which became a usual feature of Clunisian construction, from about the
middle of the twelfth century. Some have suggested that it was for overflow
congregations from the new church, or that it served for the servants of
the Abbey, for the suites of noble visitors, for the peasants from the neighbouring
towns, or for criminals seeking refuge, as they were wont to do, in
the shadow of the porch. Others have supposed, perhaps rightly, that it was
used for the reconciliation of the excommunicated, for rites of exorcism, or
for the dispensation of justice; but the most probable solution is that the
narthex was a temple, in which, at Easter and other seasons of the year, the
crowds of penitents and pilgrims&mdash;too numerous to be admitted into the
basilica, or to be left outside&mdash;might hear the Word of God at the very
threshold of, but not within, the building reserved for the monks. The
narthex was, in effect, a purgatory, a sojourning place between earth and
Heaven; the natural development of a custom which had arisen, for the
priest, by order of the bishop, to say mass as near as possible to the gates of
church, for the benefit of the penitents in the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>There existed, until the 18th century, on the left of the door of the
narthex, a stone table, which, perhaps, was formerly an altar, though
made use of, at that time, only by mothers and nurses, who believed that
they could hush their crying charges by depositing them thereon.</p>

<p>At the end of the vestibule was the original gate of the basilica, of which
the impost was the stone that St. Hugues had miraculously raised. Twenty-three
figures were carved upon it in relief, and in the tympanum above was
seated the Heavenly Father, as Teacher, His right Hand raised in benediction,
His left holding the Gospel. Beside Him the four Evangelists
listened to His words, and cloud-borne angels held the medallions upon
which were shown the Throne and Person of Christ.</p>

<p>The interior of the great basilica must have been of the most majestic and
impressive character, with its two transepts<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and double row of aisles on each
side of the nave. The great pillars supporting the central vault were seven
and a half feet in diameter, with pilasters on the side of the nave, and
engaged columns on the other three sides, meeting the aisle vaults. At the
transept, the columns, together with the pillars they surmounted, rising in
unbroken lines, formed the ribs of the vaulting. Above each bay was a triforium
of two rows of superposed, romanesque, round-headed, arcaded
arches, in threes, the lower row separated by pilasters, and the upper by
colonnettes. The arches of the bays and the transepts were pointed; a
feature, which, though quite usual in Burgundian work of the period, was
more or less accidental, and was necessitated, or rendered advisable, by practical
considerations, rather than by a deliberate departure from an architectural
style that was still of the purest Romanesque. The capitals everywhere
were ornamented with characteristic sculpture, of extraordinary freedom and
boldness, representing scriptural, and many other subjects.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the nave, close to the entry of the choir, was placed, in
after years, the tomb of Pope G&eacute;lase, and two altars, which, with a gate at
the entrance, screened the monks from the eyes of the laymen. Here, too,
against the pillars of the nave, were four large, painted, wooden statues,
representing St. Hugues, holding the model of the church in his right hand,
St. Mayeul, St. Odon, and St. Odilon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The choir occupied the space
between the two transepts; the sanctuary was carried on eight columns,
three of which were of African marble, and three of Pentelic Greek marble,
veined with blue, which St. Hugues brought from Italy by way of the
Durance and the Rh&ocirc;ne. The transept had many lateral chapels, and the
east end, which was in semi-circular form, had five apsidal chapels, vaulted
in half dome. A processional ambulatory circled the sanctuary and the
tomb of St. Hugues, in front of which stood the great altar. Here, too, at
opposite ends of the ambulatory, were placed the tombs of the Abbot Pons,
and of Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable. The vault of the apse was adorned with a fine
painting, of the end of the eleventh, or beginning of the twelfth century,
representing the Eternal Father borne upon clouds, one hand raised, and the
other placed upon the Apocalypse sealed with seven seals. At his feet was
the Lamb without Blemish, and about Him were winged figures of man, the
lion, the eagle, and the ox.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the realism of the sculpture and the painting, in spite of
the gorgeous tapestries, the golden candelabra, the pearl-encrusted ornaments
of every kind, which the noblest men and women of the time, and of later
times, showered upon Cluny, it is in the sense of spacious dignity and
majesty, rather than in the sense of ostentation and magnificence, that we
must interpret the words of Hildebrand de Mans, when he said that, "If it
were possible for the inhabitants of the heavenly mansions to be happy in an
abode fashioned by the hand of man, Cluny would be the angels' walk
(ambulatorium angelorum)."</p>

<p>Nor was the church less noble without than within. From the circular
chapels lying about her transepts and her apse, along the collateral and the
double row of flying buttresses,<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> rising higher than the narthex, the eye was
lifted, stage after stage, high above her lofty nave, to the mighty towers that
rose to the sky, in witness, for ever, one would have said, of Him whose
Dwelling was not made with hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The conventual buildings were on the south side of the basilica. From
the principal south transept, a processional, and a smaller, door, opened upon
the great romanesque cloister, of which a fragment here and there remains,
built into the modern work. It was similar in style to the other buildings
of the period. Further south were the Lady Chapel and the great refectory.
Abutting on the great wall of the Abbey, by the side of the Grosne, was a
mill and a thirteenth century bake-house, which still exist. Among the
many other buildings, chapels, baths, schools for the young, pharmacy, workshops,
dormitories, and stables, which are the necessary equipment of a great
monastery, was a large infirmary, with its own cloister and refectory&mdash;a small
establishment within the larger one. On the east side, extending to the
fortified wall that enclosed the whole monastery, were the gardens of the
abbey.</p>

<p>Such, in its essential aspects, was the "ambulatorium angelorum." How
did its occupants live? What was the rule observed within those walls?
The rule, as kept in those early days, was stern and exacting. The first of
the regulations was silence, except at stated intervals. In the church, in the
dormitory, in the refectory, in the kitchen, absolute silence, broken only by
the summoning bell or by the chanting of prayers. Like ghosts, the sandalled
monks glided about the echoing corridors; deaf mutes speaking by signs.
The times for speech were the mornings, after chapter, and evenings after
sexte. A parlour was reserved for the talkers, where, seated, book in hand,
they might converse on spiritual and other topics. Yet they were recommended
rather to remain in the cloister, and there meditate, read, pray, or
copy manuscripts. This was the hour, too, for drying their clothes in the
sun, for visiting the sick in the infirmary, for washing their cups, or for
sharpening their knives on the grindstone in the cloister. Their daily food
was limited to bread, vegetables, and fruits&mdash;meat was given only to the sick&mdash;eggs,
cheese, and fish were allowed only occasionally, and nothing whatever
might be eaten after complines. At certain seasons, the use of fat for
flavouring vegetables was forbidden. If wine were permitted, on days of
great solemnity, and during exhausting fasts, it must be free from spirituous
seasoning, and from the spice that flatters the palates of the worldly. Still
less was it permitted to drink hypocras, or oriental or Italian liqueurs&mdash;the
"little wine" of the apostle was to suffice them. Only two repasts a day
were allowed, except to the young, or to those engaged in specially hard
work.</p>

<p>The monks might shave one another once in three weeks, chanting psalms
the while, and not until the days of decadence were they shaved by a secular
barber. "In bygone times," says the chronicler, "they were not shaved,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
they were skinned."<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> They might not bathe often, lest the habit should
engender softness, and they did not usually indulge in full ablution more than
twice a year&mdash;before Christmas and Easter. Sick monks, however, might
bathe as often as they pleased.</p>

<p>The clothing allowed to the brothers consisted of a woollen shirt of dark
colour&mdash;one for the day, another for the night. Their garments were
rustic in form and substance; such as were worn by the peasants. Over the
tunic was a scapular, with a hood or capuchon attached, and over all the
frock was sometimes worn. Precious stuffs, silks, and gay colours were forbidden;
for it was unfitting, said the statutes, that monks should be apparelled
like brides for the nuptial chamber. The strict rule of St. Benedict
allowed no furs; but a concession was made to the rigour of the Burgundian
climate, and the monks might wear sheep-skin or goat-skin cloaks in winter,
and fur boots for sleeping in, but no rich and costly skins from foreign lands&mdash;"For
those who are softly clothed dwell in kings' Palaces." No monk
might eat or drink at other than the regular hours; he might not go out at
night, nor leave the monastery without the abbot's permission. When on a
journey, he should receive only monastic hospitality, and, in any event, must
never accept wine or meat; nor might he eat outside the gates, unless it were
impossible for him to return home before sunset.</p>

<p>The vice of property was resisted to the utmost. Each monk received
from the Superior, in addition to his clothing, all necessary articles, such as
a handkerchief, a knife, a needle, a writing pencil and tablet. Nothing was
the monk's own; no brother possessed money; testaments were forbidden;
and those who violated the precepts were excommunicated, and refused
ecclesiastical burial.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Above all, the Clunisian monk must earn his bread with his hands. The
earth, whence his body came, and whither it should return, must support
him. This held good for long; but in later times, the monasteries increased
in size, manual labour naturally became specialized, and some did little more
than mend their clothes, wash their linen, clean and grease their boots, and
take their turn in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"To speak truth," remarks Udalric, "the work which I saw done most
often was to free the beans of the leaves which retarded their growth, to
pluck the ill weeds from the garden, and sometimes to knead the bread in
the bake-house." Manual work, however, remained always part of the strict
rule. "Then will you be monks," said St. Benedict, "when you live by the
work of your hands, after the example of the holy preachers of the monastic
law." Bitter must it have been to Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable, the last of
the great abbots, to have to write as he did of the growing decadence:&mdash;"Idleness
is the enemy of the soul: and do we not see
the greater part of the brothers ... both within and without
the cloister, in a state of absolute inactivity. How few are they who
read, still fewer they who write! Do not the greater number sleep, leaning
against the walls, or do they not waste their day from dawn to sunset in vain
and idle, or in what is yet worse, malicious conversation." But, in the
earlier years of Cluny, the rule was not easily broken, nor broken with impunity.
A continuous surveillance, day and night, was exercised so
regularly, by monks called "circateurs," that scarcely the least fault could
be committed unseen, and punishment, inflicted in grave cases by the abbot
himself, followed hard upon the offence. Sometimes the delinquent was
condemned to solitary confinement, or to stand, all day long, at the door of
the church; sometimes he was flogged, in full chapter, by his brother monks,
or, if the fault had been publicly committed, the whipping was administered
before all the people. It was customary, also, to expose certain delinquents
before the door of the basilica, at the hour of mass, while one of the servants
of the abbey announced the cause of his penance to the worshippers as they
entered. The sinner was denied all participation in the solemnities and in
Christian communion; he was denied the kiss also. If he revolted against
his punishment, the outraged monks would drag him voluntarily to a fearful
dungeon, without door or window, into which he must descend by a ladder.</p>

<p>And over all their day of toil, of silence, of fasting, and of prayer, hung a
shadow, dark as those that fell from the vaulted nave, or lingered at sunset in
the cool cloister galleries&mdash;the shadow of ever-present death. When a
brother died, each monk, with his own hand, must sew stitches in the winding-sheet,
whose clinging folds should recall vividly to his spirit that all flesh
is as grass, and that the way of life is the way of death.</p>

<p>The monks' day was divided between work, prayer, and psalmody; the
latter sub-divided into the office and the mass, thus fulfilling literally the
words of the psalmist;<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> "Seven times in the day have I celebrated Thy
praises, and I rose in the middle of the night to confess Thy Name."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The
intervals for rest or sleep were short, and, during a part of the year, the
monks slept less than half the night. Udalric, the author of the widely-circulated
manual of the customs of Cluny, gives a vivid picture of the discipline
observed by the brothers during the "regular hours," as they were
called. At the first sound of the bell announcing nocturnes, they sat up in
bed, put on the frock without throwing off the blankets, finished dressing
without showing their legs, and descended to the church. As it might well
chance that one of them would be overcome by sleep during the psalmody
or prayer, a brother was appointed to go the round of the choir, carrying a
wooden lantern, which he would hold under the eyes of any monk whom he
believed to be asleep. If he had made a mistake, and found that his brother
was merely wrapped in meditation, he would bow low before him by way of
excusing himself; if, on the contrary, the delinquent was really asleep, the
light would be held awhile, close to his eyes. This warning would be
repeated three times during the round, and if, at the third time, the light did
not awaken the sleeper, the lantern would be left at his feet; and upon the
somnolent monk, when he awoke, fell the duty of doing the next round.</p>

<p>At the signal for matins, the monks would descend to the cloister, and
there wash their hands and faces, and comb themselves, returning to the
choir before the last stroke of the bell. There, whether they were sitting
or standing, the feet must be in line, and neither the long sleeves, nor the
skirt of the frock, must touch the ground.</p>

<p>With the addition of regular hours for reading and study, such, in short,
was the life led by the Clunisian monk, from the day of his entry, until the
tolling of bells, and the coming of the brothers with cross, candles, and
incense, announced that one more devotee had gone to receive&mdash;let us hope&mdash;the
reward of a life of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>One might be pardoned for supposing that an existence such as this we
have outlined, would have been austere enough to satisfy even the most
rigorous ascetics of the time. But it was not so. To old Pierre Damien,
for example, when he rested awhile at Cluny, to nurse in good company his
aged back, scarred by the strokes of iron rods, the rule seemed almost voluptuous.
He spoke about it to Abbot Hugh.</p>

<p class="pmb1">"If you could abstain for two days more in the week from using fat in
your victuals, you, who are so perfect in other points, would, in the matter
of mortification, be in no way behind the anchorites."</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The wary Abbot replied with a smile:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before attempting, well-beloved father, to augment our merits by augmenting
our abstinence, try yourself to bear, for eight days, the burden of
our rule; and then judge whether we can add aught to our austerities."</p>

<p>The brave old ascetic accepted the challenge, and at the end of eight days
decided that things might well remain as they were.<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The rule of Cluny
was more severe than his own.</p>

<p>Under the government of St. Hugues, grown old and gray, Cluny had
reached the summit of worldly power, and of moral influence; with him, her
best days passed. On the 29th April, 1109, the priests, loudly lamenting,
were gathered round the body of their dead saint. Clothed in his sacerdotal
robes, he lay, for three days, in the church, and a great crowd of lords and
ladies, of bourgeois, woodsmen, labourers from field and vineyard, women
and children, came to kiss his feet, and lift his raiment to their lips. On the
day before, Bernard de Varennes heard Saint Denis the Areopagite announce
to him, in a vision, that, if he wished to see again, for the last time, his friend
and abbot, Hugues of Cluny, he must haste to the dying man. Bernard
obeyed the summons, but, on his arrival, fell sick and remained three days
in a lethargy. When he came to himself, he said to the monks around him,
"Unhappy man that I am. I had come to salute my abbot, and he is dead
before the grace is granted me. But what I might not see with the eyes of
the body, I saw with the eyes of the spirit. I saw the dwellers in Heaven
descend among men, and the Mother of God, brighter than the morning star,
standing in the midst of the monks around the death-bed of Seigneur Hugues.
At the moment of the passing of his soul, spirits, armed with arrows, flew to
seize upon it, but the Mother of Mercy, raising her hand, struck them with
terror, and put them to flight, as the wind scatters the autumn leaves.
Martin, the pearl of priests, Benedict the sun of abbots, at the head of the
heavenly cohorts, bore the soul of Hugues into a fair and fertile vineyard,
that there it might rest awhile. Hugues, perceiving me in this place, addressed
me thus: 'Eat, dear friend, these bunches of white grapes, eat and
rest with me awhile; not for long am I here. When my feet are freed from
the swelling and the dust of a long earthly pilgrimage, I shall pass into the
home that God hath prepared for me throughout eternity. Recommend to
Pons, my successor, to treasure humility and innocence, to forget his own
needs for those of others, and to follow my example of monastic rule.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Pons did not follow Hugues' example of monastic rule. When his
vanity, weakness, and love of pomp had alienated a portion of his following,
he resigned his abbacy and retired. His successor, Hugues II. held office
only a few months, when the task of presiding over the destinies of Cluny
passed to Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable, the last of the great abbots, a name that already
links us in memory with him whose destiny it was, by a return to simplicity,
as a source of strength, to rival, and, for a time, to exceed the power of
Cluny. I speak of St. Bernard, the champion of the Cistercian order. We
shall meet him again at Citeaux and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is probable that St. Hugues himself, by acquiring such great wealth for
the abbey, prepared its ultimate downfall. Be that as it may, though the
rhyming Burgundian proverb,</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"En tous pays ou le vent vente</span>
<span class="i0">L'Abbaye le Cluny a rente,"</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>may not have been coined until a later century, it is certain that Cluny was
fast acquiring wealth, and succumbing to a luxury utterly alien to the Spirit
of Him Whose benediction was upon the poor and the humble. It was
natural that the order, following the fashion of the age, should wish to house
worthily the many priceless relics brought back by pious, though too
credulous, crusaders from the Holy Land, and the members of the Clunisian
school of art soon learned to vie with one another in fashioning ch&acirc;sses for
the miraculous rod with which Moses brought forth water in the desert, or
for the stone from Mount Sinai on which he kneeled when he received from
God the table of the law, or for the alabaster vase from which Mary Magdalen
anointed the Saviour's Feet.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>As the treasures grew in number, the skill of the artificers, and their passion
for exercising it increased simultaneously, until, at last, the story of the
treasures of Cluny, in the monastic inventories, is like a tale from the "Thousand
and one Nights," told in gold and jewels. When there were no more
relics to work for, the monks turned to what was next to hand, and soon,
from the crosses, from the pastoral baton, from the candelabra of gold and
silver, of crystal and ivory, from the draped altars, from the pontifical mitres,
even, diamonds and rubies flashed, opals sparkled with their changing rays,
while, sometimes, a softly-shining pearl dropped from the Abbot's sandal,
as he stepped into the blaze of light in which the great altar was bathed.</p>

<p>Not less gorgeous were the sacerdotal robes, woven always of the most
precious stuffs, and in the choicest colours, and worked, on body and sleeves,
with an infinite number of designs, lions and griffons, kings and dragons,
angels, eagles, leopards and serpents, crosses, arms, lilies, and roses. All the
rich and varied symbolism of the times shone out from the robes of Cluny.
Nor were the altars, statues, and tombs less gorgeous. The magnificent
ch&acirc;sse of St. Hugues was of precious wood, entirely covered with silver, the
reliefs representing, in gold, the mysteries of the Life and Death of the
Saviour. The pictures and altar pieces were similarly treated. One of the
statues of Mary was of gold; she held in her hand a silver candle adorned
with great pearls; she was crowned with a golden crown; precious stones
flashed upon her brow. The Infant Christ was playing with a golden
rattle, and wore, upon His Baby head, a golden crown enriched with rubies
and emeralds.</p>

<p>To such a Cluny there could only be one end. Her days, as a spiritual
force, were spent. Henceforth, to the religious world, she was to be no more
than a splendid memory; yet the soul of goodness that ever lives and moves
in things seemingly evil, had reserved wonderful uses for the work that
deft hands, otherwise idle, were still fashioning in the cloisters of Cluny.
Her lions, her lilies, her crosses in wrought gold, her symbols in chased silver
and in precious stones, had already awakened the spirit of emulation in a
thousand brooding minds. Who shall tell the debt that Gothic art owes,
that we, its inheritors, shall ever owe to the decadence of the mother abbey.</p>

<p>When we come to talk of Bernard and Citeaux, we shall hear
again of Clunisian luxury; but we have not time, nor would it repay
us, to follow, through all its stages, the decline and fall of this
Mother Church of Europe, from its glorious position as "the light
of the world," to a mere asylum for feudalism&mdash;interesting to the
student of sociology, but no longer in touch with the great onward movements
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of history. The last three centuries of the Abbey's existence make
sad reading. The envy and jealousy with which the monks were regarded
on all sides, made it hard for them successfully to cultivate and harvest their
enormous territories. Their rights and privileges, grown old and almost forgotten,
could scarcely be asserted and maintained, except by threats and
violence. The Revolution found the Benedictines in conflict with the town,
over pasturage and other rights in the woods of the monastery; and, on July
29th, 1789, the abbey was threatened by a band of armed peasants, who were
repulsed only by the united efforts of monks and townsmen.</p>

<p>On the 21st April, 1799, after considerable discussion, in which it appears
that the inhabitants of Cluny did their best, or at least made an effort, to save
the abbey, the buildings were sold to Citizen Batonard, a merchant of M&acirc;con,
for the sum of two million, fourteen thousand francs.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In spite of the lively protests of the municipality, the new-comer at once
proceeded to play havoc with the church ornaments, a feat which he followed
up by making a new road, north and south, through the precincts, cutting
the church in two. Later, the Empire completed what the Revolution had
begun. In the summer of 1811, Cluny was shaken by a series of terrific
explosions. They were blasting, with 75 bombs, the towers and sanctuary
of the Abbey.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>


<p class="p2">It is time to turn from Cluny of the past to Cluny of the present. We
have not far to go; for the town is still the abbey, and will be so yet, I hope,
for many a year to come.</p>

<p>Early on the first morning of our stay, we left the little Hotel de Bourgogne,
which stands on the site of the nave, in the very shadow of the last
remaining gaunt tower of Cluny. The entrance to the alley is through the
fa&ccedil;ade of the ancient "Palace of the Pope G&eacute;lase," as it is called, a fine,
fourteenth-century building, restored&mdash;rebuilt one might say&mdash;in 1783, and
fronting on the old courtyard of the monastery, now known as the Place de
la Grenelle, or the Place du March&eacute;, on the opposite side of which is a building
that was once the monastic stable. The upper story of the fa&ccedil;ade has
fine Gothic windows, forming almost an arcade. The trefoiled tracery is
satisfactory, and exquisitely carved faces look down upon you from the
corbels of the drip-stones. It was to Cluny, during the abbacy of Pons, that
G&eacute;lase II., ill-treated and threatened by the partisans of Henry V., fled for
rest and refuge; and here, a few days afterwards, lying upon ashes, clothed
in the robe of the Benedictine order, and surrounded by his cardinals and the
monks of the community, says a contemporary, he died "as in his own
house."<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> This palais du pape G&eacute;lase is now the principal building of the
secondary school, the "Ecole nationale des Arts et M&eacute;tiers," established in the
precincts of the abbey. We wandered for an hour about the building, endeavouring
to fashion again, in our minds, Cluny as it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing in that echoing transept, the sole relic of the great Mother
Church of Western Christendom, following the noble shafting up to where,
above the mutilated capitals, sculptured with all the naive skill and courage
of the time, the eye can reach the lofty vault, and follow round the fluted
pilasters of the triforium arcades, I felt that, of all the thousand acts of
Vandalism that the incredible, immeasurable folly and ignorance of man have
inflicted upon a long-suffering world, this is the most insufferable, the most
unpardonable. I can understand, I can almost forgive, a Puritan Cromwell,
blinded by a fanaticism, that, though savage and ignorant, was yet, in
intention, religious, battering down the statues of Mary from their niches,
and shattering with fusilades the glass that, for hundreds of years, had
bathed in loveliest colours the sunlit aisles of our Gothic cathedrals; but this
I can neither understand nor pardon&mdash;that those who, discarding all other
religions, have bowed the knee to
Reason, as the most divine attribute
of man, should have found,
in her name, a warrant to drive
a street through the abbey's
cloister garth, and blast, with the
dynamiter's bomb, the hoary
arches of Cluny.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_087.jpg" width="300" height="430" alt="Cluny; Tour des Fromages" title="" />
</div>

<p>This chapel of the normal
school, as it now is, was once the
southern limb of the great transept.
With the tower of the
Eau B&eacute;nite, the smaller tower of
the Horloge, and the Chapelle
Bourbon, it is the sole remaining
relic of the church itself. Until
after 1823, the transept was open
to the wind and rain, which
threatened ruin to the fabric. It
was decided, therefore to close
the gaping arches of the collateral
on the east and west, and to build a wall on the north side.
The immense height of the transept, emphasized by the vaulting
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
shafts, is made more striking by the small space within which it is
viewed, and the blind gallery and clerestory, with their arcades, and coupled,
engaged columns, and fluted pilasters, enable one to break through, in imagination,
that northern wall, and get a realistic glance, east and west, into the
sanctuary, and down the five aisles of the church as it was.</p>

<p>The two chapels remaining in the transept, are those of St. Martial and
St. Stephen. The former, half domed and lighted by three windows, is
similar in style to the original apsidal chapels; that of St. Stephen is fine
Gothic work of the first half of the fourteenth century. Here was buried
Pierre de Chastelux, abbot from 1322 to 1343, who bought the Palais des
Thermes, at Paris, where Jean de Bourbon, a century later, was to commence
the Hotel de Cluny. Here, too, was buried, in the middle of the
chapel, Jacques d'Amboise (1480-1510), the successor of Jean de Bourbon,
and the completer of the Palais Abbatial, here at Cluny, and of the Hotel
de Cluny at Paris. The brickwork of the south wall of the transept still
shows the position of the two doors, one for ordinary use, and one processional
gateway, leading into the cloisters.</p>

<p>The most important remaining building is the Chapelle Bourbon, which
was added to the south end of the smaller (eastern) transept by Abbot Jean
de Bourbon (1456-1480), who had his own private oratory here, whence
he could assist, through an aperture in the wall, at the ceremonies before the
great altar in the sanctuary. Enough remains of the decoration of the chapel
to show, at a glance, that it was a good example of late Gothic art. Around
it were ranged, on a series of sculptured corbels or consoles, the heads of
fifteen prophets, painted in colours. They are not lacking in expression, but
are clumsy and heavy. These busts served as supports for fifteen stone
statues, those of St. Paul, the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and the twelve
Apostles, all of which have disappeared, no one knows whither. The
guide told us that one of these statues, that of Christ, was in gold, and all the
others in silver; a statement which, if it be true, accounts sufficiently for their
disappearance. The only thing of interest remaining in the grounds of the
&eacute;cole normale is the thirteenth-century bake-house, close to the Tour du
Moulin, by the river wall.</p>

<p>The ancient wall of the abbey is broken down in many places, and part
of it is engulfed by the buildings of the town erected against it. Of the
interior towers of the abbey&mdash;besides those of the church&mdash;only two remain,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the Tour du Moulin, and the Tour des Fromages. The first, as we have
just seen is close to the river, and the second is close to the church of
Notre Dame. The origin of its curious name is not known. Of the
exterior relics of the abbey, the most interesting, architecturally and historically,
is the great entrance gate, which is high up on the side of the hill, at
the top of the road leading from the Hotel de Bourgogne, the street that
extends along the site of the nave, the narthex, the porch, and the parvis of
the basilica. On your right, as you mount the rise, you pass part of a gateway,
to the crevices of whose moulded stones cling rock plants and grasses&mdash;a
beautiful, time-mellowed ruin&mdash;all that remains of the gate of the narthex.</p>

<p>The great abbey gate is a dark and forbidding piece of masonry, in the
Roman manner, and evidently imitated from the gates of Autun. It comprises
two arches, each with fluted, engaged columns, whose richly sculptured
capitals support an ornamented archivolt. There were also fluted
pilasters supporting a cornice. The greater part of these has disappeared, as
has the attic colonnade, also imitated from the gates of Autun, and similar
to the colonnades which exist still in the Romanesque houses of Cluny.
The thickness of the pillars behind the door, and the absence of windows in
the adjoining wing of the Palais Abbatial, point to the conclusion that the
gate was fortified in the late middle ages, probably by a quadrangular tower.
Interesting as this shattered old relic is architecturally, its charm lies
in the memories of the great ones to whom it opened. All those who made
the most glorious pages of the history of Cluny have passed beneath its
arches&mdash;Priests and Saints, as St. Hugues, Pierre Damien, Ab&eacute;lard, and
Anselm; great Popes, as Hildebrand (Gregory VII.), G&eacute;lase II., Innocent
IV., Boniface VIII.; among Kings, William the Conqueror, Saint Louis,
Philippe le Bel, and his sons; Charles VI. and his uncles. Some of these
passed through in humble guise, but most came with royal, or semi-royal
pageantry, mounted on proud chargers, at the head of glittering cavalcades,
and followed by a long retinue of lords, soldiers and attendants, to partake
of the limitless hospitality of Cluny.</p>

<p class="pmb1">On the north side of this famous gate, is the Palais Abbatial, comprising
two buildings, once joined, but separated at the time of the Revolution, and
now serving as the Mus&eacute;e and the Hotel de Ville. That nearest to the gate
was built, in the latter half of the fifteenth century, by the famous abbot,
Jean de Bourbon, who added the Chappelle Bourbon to the basilica, and commenced
the Hotel de Cluny at Paris.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He was, in effect, the first of the
commendatory abbots, a system which Julien de Baleure rightly calls "vraye
sappe de l'&eacute;tat monastique et ruine des bons monast&egrave;res,"<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> since under it the
rule and revenues of the abbey passed into the hands of a stranger, who often
wholly neglected his charge, or, if he visited it at all, paid only infrequent,
ceremonial calls.</p>

<p>Jean de Bourbon, though Bishop of Puy when Charles VII. recommended
him to the choice of the monks of Cluny, was not a member of any monastic
order; nevertheless, while still remaining the "grand seigneur," he appears
to have done something to re-establish discipline in the monastery. It soon
became apparent to him that the frequent visits of distinguished persons to his
palace within the church precincts, were a menace to the peace of the
cloister. He accordingly bought land from the monks, and built his palace
adjoining the great gate, one arch of which was reserved for his private
entrance.</p>

<p>The building has undergone some modifications, but it remains a good
example of fifteenth-century work, especially the windows, which have the
typical flat arch of the period, and drip-stones with finely sculptured heads
for corbels. On the east side, a later age has painted imitations of similar
windows upon the stone wall. Within the palace are some handsome staircases
and doors, and two excellent chimney-pieces, restored, showing the
arms of Jean de Bourbon, of the Bishopric of Puy, and of the Abbey and
Town of Cluny. The arms of the town are a silver key, on azure, with
the ring below; those of the abbey are two golden keys crossed by a sword
with silver blade, the hilt downwards.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The mus&eacute;e lapidaire on the ground floor is full of interesting relics. They
need not all be catalogued here, but I must point out two or three of the
best. Probably the oldest relic there is a triangular memorial stone, in the
corner, on the left of the fire-place, with the epitaph of Aimard (Sanctus
Aimardus), third abbot of Cluny, who died in 964. Until 1872, this stone
formed the threshold of a house in the town. Another relic, not to be
missed, is the pierre tombale of St. Hugues (Abbot from 1046-1109), which
is over the door opposite to the entrance; there is also the urn that contained
his heart.</p>

</div>

<p>But the most interesting of all are some twelfth century capitals from the
ambulatory of St. Hugues' church. All of these, though showing the
naivet&eacute; of treatment characteristic of early Gothic art, are carved
with wonderful freedom, vigour, and sincerity. Figures, foliage, fruit, and
animals are all realistically produced, and grouped with a fine sense of design
and decorative effect. So strong are they, that the Gothic capitals in the
collection look weak beside them. The best of them represents God driving
a terrified Adam and
Eve from the garden
of Eden. Eve is
hiding behind Adam,
who is draped in fig
leaves. Another shows
the sacrifice of Abraham
at the moment
when he is interrupted
by the angel;
another the creation of
the world; and another
has figures of musicians,
playing various
instruments, sculptured
from elliptical medallions.
More of these
capitals would probably
have been preserved,
had the church
been demolished with
less fracas; but the revolutionaries chose the easier way, which was to blow
it to pieces with bombs; consequently the capitals, falling from so great a
height, were nearly all destroyed.</p>

<p>Among other notable things is a frieze from a twelfth century house, and
a delicious cobbler's sign, of the same period, showing the man hard at work
at his bench, assisted by his wife holding a little pot in both hands, while,
beside them, a fiddler passes the time in harmony. There is also a charming
Pascal Lamb, endowed with a seeing eye and a cloven fore-foot, which,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
turned upwards, balances a Greek cross. Another remarkable stone is that
known as the "Belle Pierre," so named from the street in which it was
found.<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It represents two knights tilting, and a bearded man riding upon
a strange beast.</p>

<p>Upstairs is a picture gallery containing old views of the Abbey, and a
number of other things worth seeing, one of the most notable being a
wooden chest of the fifteenth century, banded with iron, in which were
kept the famous Rouleaux de Cluny, archives that disappeared during the
Revolution. No official catalogue is published, so far as I am aware; but
those who desire fuller information than I have given here, can find it in
M. Penjon's book.</p>

<p>The Hotel de Ville is the eastern-most building of the two forming
the Abbot's palace. It was built by Jacques d'Amboise, in the early part of
the seventeenth century, and, during the period of the Abb&eacute;s Commendataires,
was the official residence of the grand prior. It has been so much
altered within as scarcely to be worth a visit, but the exterior, though somewhat
mutilated, retains much of its original charm. At the west entrance
is a beautiful little tower, in transitional style, with a late Gothic arch, and
cupids and foliage sculptured on the spandrils and the tympanum.</p>

<p>The main eastern fa&ccedil;ade, though somewhat unusual, is of very effective
design. Its chief characteristics are two square projecting towers, connected
by a raised balcony, with a double staircase surmounted by an ornamental,
pierced parapet. The stone towers are decorated with sculpture, in the
form of flamboyant church-window tracery below, and panels above, carved
with arabesques, foliage, lilies, grotesques, shell ornaments, etc., all in the
purest and lightest style of that early Renaissance work, which the discovery
of Italy by Charles VIII. had been the means of developing in France.
The effect of the whole, though rather conscious and artificial, is quite
pleasing and graceful. On the south wall is an inscription of Claude de
Guise, 1586.</p>

<p>From the buttressed terraces of the public gardens, around the Hotel de
Ville, you get some fine views of Cluny and the Tour de l'Eau B&eacute;nite,
extending right away to the wooded hills beyond the valley of the Grosne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Close to the great gate of the Abbey, in the Rue d'Avril, a narrow street
leading upwards out of the Rue de la R&eacute;publique, are a number of those
Romanesque houses of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, for which Cluny
is famous. Up to about sixty years ago, whole streets of this little Burgundian
town had remained for seven or eight centuries almost unchanged,
but the utilitarian and commercial spirit of the age has made itself felt, even
in this out of the way corner of Burgundy, and, one by one, the Romanesque
houses are disappearing. Two remain, however, in the middle of the town;
and, in addition to those in the Rue d'Avril, there are two adjoining
one another in the Rue de la R&eacute;publique, above the Hotel de Ville.
Beside these is a house of the fifteenth century. Indeed, it would be still
possible, in this town, to trace the evolution of domestic architecture, almost
without a break, from the twelfth century to the present time.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The Romanesque houses of Cluny follow, pretty closely, a general type.
The window arcades reveal at once the great influence of the abbey church.
The majority of these houses are what we call terrace-built; and are entered
from the street by a door which opens into the front room, or shop, and
leads up the staircase to the first floor. At the back of the front room or shop
was an open court yard, with a well in one corner of it. Across the
court yard a covered passage led to a kitchen at the back. The upper floor
was similar in design, with a roofed gallery leading to a room above the
kitchen. The first floor front room was the bedroom of the tenant, his wife,
and children; while the servants and apprentices did as best they could in the
attic above; for the practice of rigidly separating the sexes did not come in
until the twelfth century. Each house showed a pleasing elevation, and was
erected with a solidity and elegance of design far excelling anything
seen in the same class of building to-day. The shop front was formed by
one great arch, without windows, but closed at night by a shutter, which,
dropped during the day, formed a counter for the exhibition of the shopman's
wares. Customers did not enter the shop, but transacted their business
across the counter, and no tradesman might call a purchase from another
shop until the latter had finished his business. Different trades were kept
together in particular streets&mdash;hence such names as the Rue des Tanneurs,
which still exists in Cluny. Above the ground floor were two other stories,
of which the upper one was generally lighted by an arcade of round-headed
arches, imitated from the Abbey, with sculptured piers or colonnettes, surmounted
by a carved cornice or architrave, and protected by overhanging
eaves.<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">These charming houses were among the earliest examples of domestic
architecture in stone, and it is very interesting to notice that the builders have
made no attempt to adhere to the principles of wooden construction; but have
followed the right masters, the ecclesiastical builders. One of the best of the
old houses is that popularly known as the Hotel des Monnaies, on the right
as you go up the Rue d'Avril. In this case the windows are square-headed,
but the most interesting characteristics are the projecting chimney, and the
great arches, revealing the extraordinary thickness of the walls, a feature
which lends some colour to the legend that this is the old mint of the Abbey.
I will not mention any more particular houses; only let me assure the reader
that he who walks the streets of Cluny remembering that the older portions
of it are built with the very stones of the ruined abbey, will assuredly have
his reward.</p>

<p>The churches of the town are not particularly interesting. St. Marcel, a
somewhat barrack-like building of the twelfth century, at the station end of
the town has a good Clunisian clock-tower. The building is roofed with
wood, because, having no buttresses, it would not stand the thrust of vaulting.
The &eacute;glise Notre Dame, in the centre of the town, is more attractive;
though its thirteenth-century fa&ccedil;ade is mutilated. Birds rest upon the backs
of the gargoyles, and upon the ends of the broken shafting; and dirty children
play, all day long, upon the steps of the porch. The interior, however, has
some good work in the capitals, mouldings, and vaulting shafts of the nave.
The engaged vaulting shafts of the aisles are probably remains of an older
church, as they have squared plinths and clawed angles, transitional in style.
If anyone cares to see to what a plight the lost art of making stained glass
can come, let him look at the tympanum of the door of Notre Dame de
Cluny. The building adjoining the church has a Renaissance door, and a
thirteenth-century arcade on the upper floor.</p>

<p>There are two other houses, at least, in Cluny, to which, I suppose, I
should draw attention. The first of them is the Hotel Dieu, a seventeenth-century
building on the site of the old hospital of Cluny, of which a few
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
vestiges yet remain. Neither the architecture, nor the kindred arts of that
period, have ever aroused much enthusiasm in me; consequently, I remember
almost nothing of the fabric itself, and my general impression is little more
than a blaze of garden flowers, tempered by delicious palm-leaves, and
dotted here and there with pale invalids, chatting in groups, or walking or
sitting beside the flowers. Within the entrance hall the frail voices of nuns
earnestly intoning prayers in unison awakened the religious spirit within me
far more effectively than had the deserted nave of Notre Dame, or of St.
Marcel. Their solemn chant and the austere cleanliness that reigned everywhere,
awed me so that I crept out on tip-toe into sunlight again, without
more than a glance at the famous Bouillon statues that I had come there
expressly to see.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Bouillon, abbot of Cluny from 1683 to 1715, had
intended to erect, to the memory of his father and mother, at the southern
end of the small transept of the abbey church&mdash;opposite to the Chappelle
Bourbon&mdash;a monumental tomb that should be worthy of a family and
individual so illustrious as that brother of Turenne, who had faced Richelieu,
and played a leading part in the Fronde.</p>

<p>But the cardinal had reckoned without Louis XIV. That monarch, hearing
of the project, made further inquiries; and decided, as the report of
d'Aguerriau, which preceded the royal veto, put it, "That every part of this
design tended equally to preserve and immortalize, by the religion of an ever-durable
tomb, the too-ambitious pretensions of its author towards the origin
and grandeur of his house."</p>

<p>It was an ironical fate that chose such means for preserving the statues,
which were already on their way from Rome. Had the Roi Soleil permitted
the erection of the monument, not a vestige of it, probably, would
have survived the Revolution; consequently, its statues would not, to-day,
adorn the chapel of the Hotel Dieu at Cluny. The loss of the mausoleum
we need not regret; but the statues, though, to my mind, too artificial and
conscious to be pleasing, are carved with skill and vivacity, and are generally
considered to be among the best examples of their kind. The bas-relief of
the battle scene, on the plinth below the male figure, is, to many, the most
interesting part of the work.</p>

<p>On the way back to the town, on the right hand side, a lion, quite
Byzantine in character, and taken, I imagine, from the abbey church, forms
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the sign of the caf&eacute; "Lion d'Or." In the lower part of the town, in the
Rue Prudhon, not far from the church of St. Marcel, is a modest little
dwelling, whereon the passer-by may read the name of the greatest Burgundian
painter, Prudhon, born there on April 4th, 1758. The French
Correggio, as he has been called, after the Italian master who exercised most
influence upon him, represents very faithfully,
in the quality of his art, some of the characteristics
of the land of its birth. On this more
mountainous side of Burgundy, west of the
C&ocirc;te d'Or, we should expect to find, in a
modified form, along with the typical Burgundian
qualities of vivacity, strength, solidity, and
grace, some of the passion, the sterner qualities
of the harder, hill-bred race, more closely in
touch with the sterner aspects of nature&mdash;especially
in the case of one whose birth
synchronized with the birth-throes of the
great Revolution. It may be, too&mdash;and it appeals to one's historic
sense to believe&mdash;that something of the stern ethical ideal of Cluny
had passed into the mind of one who was born beneath the shadow of the
abbey towers. Many of those, however, to whom the works of Prudhon are
familiar, find greater pleasure in his lighter, allegorical paintings, such as
those in the Mus&eacute;e at Montpellier, which, perhaps, show the influence of
his predecessor Greuze, who, born in Tournus, by the wide pastures of the
Sa&ocirc;ne, represents the more peaceful, pastoral, and lighter aspect of Burgundian
art.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_099.jpg" width="160" height="157" alt="Ornament" title="" />
</div>

<p>In connection with Prudhon, and with a parallel drawn between his work
and that of Greuze, M. Perrault-Dabot, in his book, "L'Art en Bourgogne,"
and Mont&eacute;gut also, in his "Souvenirs," speak of a type of feminine beauty at
Cluny, which, I must confess, escaped my notice, as it did also the not unobservant
eyes of my wife.</p>

<p>"In the same way," says M. Perrault-Dabot, "the type of woman that
one still meets to-day, at Cluny, recalls to us the shadowy grace and the
warm suavity of Prudhon's talent. Cluny belongs to that region of our
province where the massy heads and highly-coloured complexions that distinguish
the mountain-dweller, disappear, to give place to subtler, slighter
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
forms, and to faces of an exquisite pallor. It is not that perfect beauty in
which every feature is regular; but it is beauty in its most suave and
touching form."</p>

<p>We were the more disappointed, because, though we had not expected to
find in Cluny any rivals to the classic beauties of Arles and St. R&eacute;my, we
had come prepared for a welcome break in the monotonous plainness of
Burgundian humanity, a subject on which I shall have more to say later on.
Yet the types we met hereabouts, if not, on the whole, attractive, were certainly
not without the individuality that natural vivacity imparts. My wife,
sketching the great gate of the abbey, was scandalized by the inordinate
amount of child-smacking indulged in by the mothers of the neighbourhood.
I was not a witness on that occasion, but I am inclined to think, that, in most
cases, she failed to allow for the excitability of a semi-southern temperament,
and, could she have read them, would have found more hardness in the hands
than in the hearts.</p>

<p>The little Hotel de Bourgogne, a white, straggling old building, snugly
placed beneath the protecting walls of the Tour de l'Eau B&eacute;nite, added its
quota to our amusement. The ways of the establishment were refreshingly
unconventional. For example, they rang neither bell nor gong for dinner,
but sent up two maids, who popped their tousled heads simultaneously in at
the bedroom door, and invited us to come down to a meal, which, by the
way, quite maintained the traditions of later Clunisian luxe.</p>

<p>The company, too, was notable. We sat at the head of the table. On
my right was an individual whose cruel, yet suffering, face reminded me of
the executioner in Van der Weyden's great picture in the hospital at Beaune.
I gathered that the digestive organs were the seat of his troubles; for he rejected,
with a grunt, the normal fare, preferring to dine on lightly-boiled
eggs, whose liquid contents he imbibed by a peculiar, sucking process, that
was, in its way, a clever, though noisy, gastronomic feat.</p>

<p>To us there entered an angelic newsboy, ragged yet smiling. He distributed
evening "Matins" all round the table, and departed, as radiant as
he had come. At the far end of the table, a twentieth-century Mephistopheles,
with the traditional lowering brows and cunning smile, was transmitting
improper stories to a delighted Falstaffian neighbour; just as certain
decadent fat abbots of Cluny were wont to do, over a bottle of sparkling
Meursault, in those generous, degenerate days. The ample man on his left
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
listened covertly, and cleaned his mouth with his fingers, while the red wine,
poured in that nervous, spasmodic, Burgundian manner, gurgled from the
bottle neck into the bubbling, ruby lake below.</p>

<p>After dinner, came coffee and cigars, in the little caf&eacute; adjoining, of which
the floor is covered with sawdust, and the ceiling with flies. Madame, a
good-natured woman, dressed in flaming yellow satin, adorned with much
lace and passementerie, and possessing a very arch manner, where the men
were concerned, suggested to some of her intimates that they should join her
in a game of cards. Two of them at once consented; but a third invit&eacute;&mdash;an
elephantine Burgundian voyageur de commerce&mdash;ruminating over a petit
verre in the corner, declined, on the plausible pretext that he had "no small
vices." Indeed, nothing about him was small! For our part, we fell into
agreeable conversation with another habitu&eacute; of the hotel, a gentleman also
suffering from the amplitude engendered by two six-course meals a day,
washed down with copious libations of red wine. He displayed a kindly interest
in my wife's sketches, and was particularly complimentary concerning
one reproduced in this book, representing a corpulent person&mdash;who might
well have been himself&mdash;sitting on a dangerously small chair before a caf&eacute;
table.</p>

<p>He had commenced to practise upon us his limited supply of English,
when our intercourse was interrupted, during the temporary absence of
Madame on domestic duties, by the advent, through the balcony leading to
the street, of a small pinched boy and girl, both in advanced stages of tatters
and dirt, who abruptly announced their intention of entertaining us with a
"petit chanson." Taking our silence for consent, they stood, side by side,
in the middle of the sanded floor, and, lifting grimy faces to the fly-spotted
ceiling, proceeded, with one accord, to give vent to a series of extraordinarily
discordant sounds, which, to the universal relief, were interrupted by the reappearance
of Madame, who bustled into the room, and "shoved" the
juvenile vocalists out of it, barely giving them time to collect largesse during
their flight.</p>

<p>"Two young hooligans!" (apaches), she said severely, and, smoothing the
ruffled yellow satin, sat down again to enjoy her "small vice."</p>

  <img src="images/i_b_102.jpg" width="250" height="314" alt="Cluny; a Capital from the Abbey" title="" />
</div>

<p>That night I dreamed a dream. I was back in the twelfth century, as a
brother, participating in a solemn mass in the great abbey of Cluny. The
sanctuary and the transepts of the mighty church were flooded in the soft
light, that, streaming from gold and jewelled candelabras, flickered upon the
bent forms of the dark-robed priests, and threw into strong relief the flutings
of the pilasters that adorned the huge piers, and the strange birds and beasts
that gazed from the foliage of the capitals. Above us, the lines of the soaring
vault were lost in eternal shadows, and before us a thousand lights and
jewels blazed upon the High Altar, where Hugues himself, gloriously
arrayed in cope and mitre, was kneeling before the holy rood. The solemn
chanting of the mass sobbed and
echoed down the lofty nave, across
the shadowy aisles, and up to where,
upon the eastern dome, the Eternal
Father Himself, cloud-borne, among
the symbols of His creation, lifted
the Right Hand in blessing, and
laid His Left Hand upon the Book
sealed with seven seals. Suddenly,
while our souls were pouring themselves
out in rapt adoration, a fearful
detonation resounded above our
heads. Startled, terrified, we looked
up. As we did so, while yet the
echoes of the shock were rolling
through the upper darkness, a series
of crackling explosions shook the
whole fabric to its foundations.
The floor heaved, the vaulting above our heads cracked from side
to side, the huge pillars trembled and tottered. Then an awful
cry of alarm was stilled into the louder silence of horror, as the whole
mighty building swayed, and towers, columns, vaults, and capitals collapsed,
and, with an appalling crash and a roar like the fall of many waters, buried
all in universal ruin.... I awoke&mdash;to find myself yet alive, in the
prosaic twentieth century, while from the house opposite proceeded uproarious
sounds of revelry by night, carried on with that sustained exuberance
which the Latin races alone can impart to their festivals. It was not Cluny
that was falling again, but furniture, glasses and crockery. Then it all
came back to me&mdash;the tale I had heard of the impending marriage of Yvonne.
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
They were worthily celebrating the occasion. Blessings upon her! I rose
and leaned out of the casement. Two or three songs were being sung,
simultaneously, to the accompaniment of a running chorus of applause, and
an obbligato with the chairs of the salon.</p>

<p>Until the orgy was at an end, I lay awake, meditating upon my dream,
and finding, to my sorrow, a real historical analogy between that tipsy revel
and the ever-to-be-regretted fall of the stones of Cluny.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, I started on my bicycle for Berz&eacute;-le Chatel, a castle
about twelve miles from Cluny, on the road to M&acirc;con. On the steps of the
hotel I was accosted affably, in the English tongue, by a gentleman, whose
face was quite unfamiliar to me. He assured me, however, that he had met
us at Bourg en Bresse; and I, being unable either to deny or to affirm the
assertion, must needs listen. Having finished with the weather, he paused,
turned, waved his hand towards the gray abbey tower, that rose above our
heads, and said majestically, with an air of imparting valuable information;
"C'est ancien." Being still heavy for want of sleep, I just cursed him
inwardly, and went my ways.</p>

<p>As you mount the road that winds upwards towards Berz&eacute;, there opens out
a most lovely view over the green valley of the Grosne, whose windings are
marked by tall poplars, through which shine the distant towers and hills of
Cluny. Then come four or five kilometres of typical Burgundian climbing,
before you gain the crest of the ridge, and find yourself looking down, and
away for mile after mile, until, between a succession of rugged hills, that lie
like prehistoric monsters couchant towards the southern sun, among golden
vineyards dotted with ancient villages and immemorial walls, the serpenting,
poplar-fringed stream is lost to sight, where at last, far off, in the blue
distance, the valley merges into the great plain of the Sa&ocirc;ne. To the left,
on a spur of the hill, guarding proudly the hamlet that shelters at its base,
rise the time-bronzed towers of the great castle of Berz&eacute;.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The Castle of Berz&eacute;, now the residence of the Comte de Milly, became
one of the defensive fortresses of the Abbey and town of Cluny, according
to the treaty of 1250, which, through the intervention of Blanche de
Castille, set forth the respective powers, and adjusted the somewhat strained
relations of the lords of Berz&eacute; and the Abbots of Cluny. It gave to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Seigneurs of Berz&eacute;-le Chatel, the right to administer justice over the
abbatial lords in the neighbourhood of the castle, including Berz&eacute;-la Ville.
Moreover, it bound the tenants of these lands to come together "at the
clamour of the castle," to defend and guard it, in return for which assistance,
they were granted, in war time, the right of shelter within the fortress, both
for themselves and their goods. From that time forward, the Abbots and
Seigneurs were on such good terms, that some of the latter subscribed liberally
to the Abbey, and even obtained the privilege of burial within its
precincts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_104.jpg" width="620" height="317" alt="Ch&acirc;teau de Berz&eacute;" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">In legend, as well as in history, Berz&eacute; has played its part. A Seigneur of
the castle, it is said, piqued by a morbid curiosity, shut up in the lowest
donjon an ox and a man, that he might know which would die first. Tradition
avers that his passion for knowledge remained unsatisfied, since
both died together. In 1315, Geoffrey de Berz&eacute;, tiring of his
diurnal occupations, namely, hunting in the morning and beating his
servants at night, raised an impious hand against, and let it descend upon,
the archdeacon of M&acirc;con, who, through the chapter, brought a complaint
before parliament; with the result that Geoffrey and his successors were
condemned, in perpetuity, to burn, every year, a candle of fifty pounds
weight in the choir of the cathedral of M&acirc;con. This fine was still being
paid, up to the close of the eighteenth century, when it was customary to set
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
forth in bad verses, on a card at the foot of the chandelier that carried the
candle, an explanation of this "amende honorable."</p>

<p>Berz&eacute;-le Chatel was prominent, too, in those bloody wars of the Armagnacs
and Bourguignons, which, for more than thirty years, drenched the
stricken land of France in the blood of her bravest men. Later on, it fell
into the hands of the Dauphin, afterwards Charles VII., who, by magnificent
promises, succeeded in inducing the governor to betray the Duke
of Burgundy. It did not remain long in the hands of the French; for local
knowledge of the subterranean passages soon effected its recapture by the
Burgundians, who, to the terror of the French soldiers, seemed to have arisen
mysteriously from the earth. The last siege of the castle took place in 1591,
when the Duc de Namours after making a breach in the walls with artillery,
captured it for the Huguenots, whose attacks it had resisted hitherto.<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>A path leads off the road, down through the vines, and up to the cottages
at the castle foot, where you can climb, by another steep stony way, to the
great, double-towered gate, guarded by machicolations and portcullis, and
bearing the coat-of-arms of the house of Berz&eacute;. Within is a lawn,
encircling a little pond, and an ivied avenue of ancient firs, whose
sombre hues set off, in summer, the vivid scarlet of the geraniums, and the
soft tints of the laburnum. Crossing this grassy, stoutly-walled terrace, you
pass beneath another fortified gate, where scarlet creepers cling, to the court
yard of the castle, bright with beds of fuschias, and masses of ball-shaped
white flowers. Shade is given by a great walnut-tree; and here, too, is an
adjunct, indispensable now, as in medi&aelig;val times,&mdash;a well. The fa&ccedil;ade of
the house shows, upon its soft, gray stone, the typical cupid's bow windows
of the fifteenth century. Across the dwarf wall, the view extends away,
eastward, over a lower terrace, to the trimly-kept kitchen gardens, and
ancient out-buildings; westward to the vine-clad hills. This is a castle of
enchantment, in whose flowery courts one can recall visions of the purple
past that has floated over the towers of Berz&eacute;.</p>

<p>Leaving the castle, and passing down the great double avenue of walnuts
and sycamores which connect it with the romanesque church of the Village
of Berz&eacute;, I stood, looking at the curious staircase that leads, between roofed-in
buttresses, to the church tower. An old woman passed me, carrying, by
a yoke on her shoulders, two large buckets of water.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose castle is this, Madame?"</p>

<p>"This is Monsieur le Comte de Milly's, monsieur," and she bowed
slightly; whether to me or to the great name, I do not know. Two jets
of water splashed over her sabots.</p>

<p>We went our ways; she looking down at her wet feet, and I thinking
of the Marquis of Carabas&mdash;not by reason of any legendary connection
between that potentate and the ch&acirc;teau of Berz&eacute;, but because the turn of
her phrase had recalled my first reading of "Puss in Boots."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_106.jpg" width="620" height="249" alt="Ch&acirc;teau de Lourdon" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Another of the guardian castles of Cluny, that to which in dangerous
times the treasures, charts, and title deeds of the Abbey were taken, was the
Ch&acirc;teau de Lourdon. It was pillaged in 1575 by the partisans of the Duc
d'Alen&ccedil;on, who burned so many of the original papers that Claude de Guise,
after his reconciliation with Henry IV., obtained letters patent rendering
valid the existing copies of the parchments. In 1632, Richelieu, who had
obtained possession of the Abbey of Cluny, ordered the demolition of the
donjon and castle of Lourdon, a command so faithfully carried out that
nothing was left of the fortress, except what is to be seen to-day&mdash;a ruined
ivy-hung wall, its line broken by a round tower, through whose windows
you can see the concierge moving, and by a curious row of great columns,
like organ pipes, now generally supposed to be the remains of a kind of
medi&aelig;val tennis court. From the castle rising high above the bush-covered
rocks, you can look down over the grape vines to the village of Lourdon, and
the hills of the Grosne valley. Looking up at it, through the houses of the
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
village street, it must have appeared a not unworthy guardian of a trust so
great as were the treasures of Cluny.</p>

<p>The best way to get there by the valley road from Cluny, is to turn up
the hill when you come to a small sentinel tower. If you ask the way, you
will probably be told, as we were, to turn at the next lane, which is longer,
less convenient, and gives a much less striking approach to the castle. Persistent
mis-direction of strangers is a common Burgundian failing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Those who have wandered about the streets of Cluny may have happened
upon the late fifteenth century, or early sixteenth century, house of the Prat
family, the ancestors of the poet Lamartine, whose name is frequently heard
by travellers in the M&acirc;connais or the Dauphin&eacute;; though the nation as a
whole, soon forgot him, after that swiftly rising wave of latin enthusiasm
had swept him into the seats of the mighty, and, receding, had dragged him
with it, to face, as best he might, the obscure, penniless life of a literary hack.</p>

<p>His birthplace, at Milly, is not now in existence; but the prospect of seeing
the family Ch&acirc;teau de Saint Point, where part of his youth, and some
later years of retirement, were passed, tempted me to pay a visit to that
valley. In a very improbable, though naturally written and pathetic study
of rustic life, "Le Tailleur de Pierres de St. Point"&mdash;he who died of that,
unhappily, rare malady, the love of God&mdash;we have Lamartine's own description
of his home.</p>

<p>From the mountain side projects a low hill "dominated at its summit by
an old castle flanked by compact towers, and by the notched spire of a
romanesque church tower. At the foot of the hill are pastures bordered with
alders, cherry and large nut trees, between whose trunks can be seen the
walls, roofs and rustic bridge of a hamlet built in the shadow of the castle
and comprising fifteen or twenty cottages of workmen, small farmers or shopkeepers,
all grouped around the village church. These old towers, undermined
at their bases by the weather, and cracked by the weight of stone above
them, shorn of the spires at their summits, are useless to-day, except to flank
a heavy square mass of naked stone, pierced with a winding stair and several
vaulted rooms&mdash;such is my abode.... Thence the view, falling and
rising, extends over the most beautiful part of the valley of St. Point. One's
glance, following the rapid slope of the pastures, rests upon a field through
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the middle of which runs the river 'Vallonge.' Great nut trees with bronze
foliage, motionless as metal leaves, poplars with trunks storm-twisted, and
with foliage more hairy and whiter than the head of an old man, European
cypresses, alders, birches, willows rescued by me, twenty-five years ago now,
from the bill of the tree-trimmer, leaning from bank to bank of the river they
love and are loved by, interwoven over its course, form a lofty, floating,
capricious vault of foliage of every tint, a very mosaic of vegetation. The
lightest airs of summer sway this moving curtain, and summon thence waves
of sound, breathings, the watery sheen of leaves, flights of birds and vegetable
scents, which gladden the eyes, vary the outlook, and rise in sweet sounds and
wandering fragrances to the balcony of my house."</p>

<p>This balcony was the construction in sculptured stone, in imitation of the
old Gothic Balustrades of Oxford, that he had added to the principal fa&ccedil;ade.
Here the peacocks perching, day and night, bordered its heavy stones with a
row of living caryatides, as they spread their brilliant tails to the sun.<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, with such passages as these in my mind, I was making for the
village. Having climbed the winding staircase that leads up to the terraced
churchyard, I saw, as I drew near, across the tangled graves, the tomb of
Lamartine, a pretentious, but quite unsuccessful, production, in bastard gothic
style, the interior hung round with horrible wreaths of artificial flowers. On
a pedestal was a bust of the poet, with a metal urn on each side, and, below,
a recumbent statue of his wife, and memorials of other descendants.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of intense relief that I turned from the artificial to
the real, to the monument in which nature's art, that is not artifice, has
immortalized the memory of Lamartine.</p>

<p>Here is the primitive little romanesque church, whose gracious tower is
now hoary with years, and golden with the kisses of the sun. One's glance
rests long upon those stones, where, above the slender colonettes, among the
waving grasses, wild flowers, ferns, and soft moss of the slag roof, the stone
corner-heads of a thousand years ago watch silently over a tree-embowered,
weed-entangled, dreamy garden of the dead. For these are the living
memorials of a poet&mdash;the wide, green meadow of the valley, the undulating
boughs, and gray and silver glimpses of the breeze-swung poplars, the red
tiles of the ancient village, the stream willow-fringed, the creamy cattle
browsing in upland pastures, the gracious contours of woodland hill, touched
by Autumn's mellowing hand, the blue dome above, whose silver islands float
on the wings of a warm, south wind.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>His memories linger, too, in melodious songs, sung by poets not less than
he, the lark in the blue, the thrush on the bough, the zephyrs among the
leaves; the distant tap, tap, tap, of the woodpecker in the far-off forest, or
of some follower of that stone-cutter of St. Point, with whom Lamartine,
high up in the mountain quarry, talked of the ways of God with man. One
day, perhaps, France will realize these truths; then she will cease to desecrate,
with hideous monuments, the open spaces of her ancient villages, and
the resting place of her illustrious dead.</p>

<p>Having been assured by a villager that visits to the Ch&acirc;teau were permitted,
encouraged even, I effected an entrance to the grounds, through a
gate in the wall on the north side of the church. The building appears to
be a patchwork of many dates, marred by some wretched, modern imitations,
and the hideous device, not infrequent hereabouts, of painting sham gothic
windows on a plaster wall; but the general effect of the whole, matured by
age, set in finely timbered grounds, is not unpleasing. I wish I could say the
same for my welcome, which might be summed up in these words: "Come
in, go through; damn you, get out!"</p>

<p>The cicerone who, by the way, was kind enough to inform me that no
part of the building was of earlier date than the nineteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> was so
rude that I felt much more disposed to discuss with her, gently but firmly,
the question of manners, than to look at the many relics she was able to
show me.<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that only three courses are open to the owner of an historic
house. He can refuse admission to the public; he can grant admission unconditionally;
or he can grant admission on payment, or on other reasonable
conditions; but, upon whatever terms he admits you, he must make you
welcome, so long as you, in your turn, conform to the exigencies of polite
society. A thinly veiled attitude of hostility deprives the self-respecting
visitor of all pleasure.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Be it added, however, lest I should discourage others
from visiting the castle, that the account of my experience was received most
apologetically by several villagers, who assured me that the present inhabitants
were "gentils," and that my cold reception must have been due to the
fact, of which I was, of course, unaware, that there was illness in the house.</p>

<p class="pmb3">My wrath having been appeased by lunch, and the attentions of a good-natured
hostess, I proceeded boldly to climb to the head of the Valley of St.
Point, and, after many kilometres of very hard work, was rewarded by a
look back over the Valley, from below Tramaye. In the middle distance,
shone, in the afternoon sun, bronze and white among the tapering poplars,
the Village of St. Point, crowned by the ancient gray church; and, higher
yet, the sombre trees of the garden, and the towers of Lamartine's ch&acirc;teau.
Above Tramaye, itself a very eagle's aerie, one by one the lower valleys open
out to view, until, at last, crossing the "col," you descend, for kilometre after
kilometre, to Clermain in the Valley of the Grosne, one of the once-fortified
advance-guard villages protecting the approach to Cluny from the South.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Purity and simplicity having been always potent factors in the development
of the spiritual life, it followed, as the night the day, that Cluny's ever-growing
indulgencies and luxury, while they sapped her own strength, laid
her open to supercession by the devotees of an uncorrupted order. By the
time of Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable, that rival had already arisen. The Cistercian
Order, under the rule of St. Bernard, at Clairvaux, had already supplanted
Cluny as the first religious power of Europe. The story of the rise of
Citeaux is full of legendary and historical interest.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eleventh century, Eringarde, the wife of Theodoric,
a nobleman of Normandy, was about to become a mother. On the
eve of the expected birth, the Holy Virgin appeared to the lady, and showed
to her a golden ring, saying: "With this ring I betrothe to myself the son
whom you shall bring into the world." The child was baptized under the
name of Robert. When he was grown up, and had heard the story of his
mother's vision, he left his native home, and betook himself to Burgundy,
there to consecrate a monastery to the cult of God and St. Mary. The spot
he chose for the foundation, in the year 1075, was in the forest of Mol&ecirc;me,
beyond Ch&acirc;tillon. There a company of fellow anchorites built, of the
branches of trees, a chapel in honour of the Virgin, and there, in that solitude,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
they led a life so austere, so laborious, so fervent, that the monks of Mol&ecirc;me
came to be known rather as angels than men.</p>

<p>But, before many years had passed, abundance and prosperity had brought
about a general lassitude, and departure from the austerity of the early rule.
Robert's disciples mutinied against their Abbot, who then knew that the time
for departure was come. Early in the year 1098, a little band of Benedictine
monks, twenty-one in number, including Robert, the prior, and sub-prior,
might have been seen issuing from the abbey gateway of Mol&ecirc;me. They
took with them no other provision for their travels than the vestments and
sacred vessels for the celebration of the most holy mysteries, and a large
breviary for the due performance of the divine office. Through wild and
rugged paths, by mountain and forest, they journeyed on, chanting the divine
praises, until, in the midst of the great plain of Burgundy, they came upon
a vast solitude, the haunt of wild beasts, which, among the forest trees, found
shelter in the underwood and brambles. Here, as they wended their way
along the banks of a stream, beside reed-fringed, stagnant pools, where only
the discordant cry of the water-fowl broke the awful silence of nature, the
travellers heard a voice from Heaven, crying "Sistite hic!" (halt here), and
knew that this forest was the spot in which God willed that they should serve
Him.</p>

<p>Obtaining grant of the land, and aid, from Eudes, Duke of Burgundy,
and the Vicomte de Beaune, whose it was, they raised their monastery, which
was solemnly dedicated, on the 21st March, 1098, to the Virgin Mary, and
named Citeaux, in memory of the divine command they had heard.<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>St. Robert stayed only for one year in Citeaux, before an order of the
sovereign pontiff recalled him to Mol&ecirc;me; but the new monastery continued
to flourish under the guidance of Stephen Harding, a young English
monk.</p>

<p>About this time it pleased the Virgin to show conspicuously to the brethren
her good pleasure in the life they were leading in her honour. One day,
when they were chanting matins, Mary, Queen of Heaven and Earth,
resplendent in glory, appeared to them with the first rays of the dawn, and,
in a moment, with a touch of her hand, changed the tawny robes of the
Cistercians into garments of spotless purity. The vision vanished; but cowl
and tunic retained the dazzling brilliancy of snow.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the pious cenobites
understood that they must adopt, henceforth, the white dress, as symbol
of her&mdash;that flawless lily-of-the-valley&mdash;whose servants they were, and towards
whose unspotted purity they were ever to strive.<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>In after years, when the black monks reproached the Cistercians with
wearing a garment fit only for a time of joy, whilst the monastic state was
one of penitence, the white monks would answer, that the religious life was
not only one of penitence, but was like that of the angels, and therefore they
wore white garments to show the spiritual joy of their hearts.<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The Cistercian
habit bore about it another touch of grace, derived from long and holy
association. In the black scapular, worn over the white tunic, broad about
the shoulders, then falling in a narrow strip to the feet, they saw the form of
the Lord's cross, and thus they loved to bear it about with them, even in
their sleep.<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> And notwithstanding their coarser bread, hard beds, and
clothing no better than that of the peasantry, there was ever a cheerfulness
about the Cistercians that comes always to him whose heart beats in sympathy
with the warm heart of mother nature, whose work lay where their
days were passed, not in towns, but in sequestered valleys and lonely uplands,
among fruitful vineyard, meadow, and cornfield.</p>

<p>After a while, upon Citeaux, too, in its turn, came evil days, when one by
one the monks fell away and died, until Stephen began to doubt whether the
austerities of his rule were not above human strength, and to fear that God
had willed the destruction of the new community. One day, when he, with
his brothers, was seated at the bed-side of a dying priest, he told the sufferer
of his fear, and ordered him, in Christ's Name, to return from among the
dead, and reveal to him God's Will concerning the future of the Abbey.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The monk promised to do so, in so far as might be permitted him. Then
he died.</p>

<p>Some days after the passing of that brother, Stephen, at work in the fields,
gave the signal for rest. Withdrawing himself from the others, he knelt
down to pray, when the dead monk, ashine with heavenly light, and seeming
rather to float above the ground than to be standing upon it, appeared to him.</p>

<p>"Father," said he, "The Lord Christ has sent me to tell you that your way
of life is good in His sight, and that the desolation and sterility of Citeaux
are about to pass away. Soon your children will be saying to you, 'Make
room for us; the abode is too narrow; enlarge its boundaries.' Multitudes
of men will come to range themselves beneath your crook, and among them
shall be many learned ones, and many a lord. Your disciples, in number as
bees when they swarm, shall go hence to found new abbeys in far off lands."</p>

<p>Not long after this vision, one evening, in the year 1113, whilst Stephen
and the remnant of his little flock were imploring God to fulfil His promises,
a band of thirty persons, under the guidance of a young man, was slowly
traversing the forest towards the abbey. Soon the sound of the iron knocker,
clanging upon the gate, summoned the porter, whose bell announced the
arrival of strangers. The new-comers entered, prostrated themselves at the
feet of Stephen, and begged to be admitted into the number of his monks.
They were a notable company; young lords, noble in feature and deportment,
from among the greatest houses in Burgundy; older men who had
shone in the councils of princes, and had worn, hitherto, only the furred
mantle, or the steel hauberk, now to be exchanged for the lowly cowl of St.
Benedict.</p>

<p>"At the head of the troops was a young man of about twenty-three years
of age, of exceeding beauty. He was rather tall of stature, his neck long
and delicate, his whole frame very thin like that of a man in weak health.
His hair was of a light colour, and his complexion fair; but with all its
pallor, there was a virgin bloom spread over the thin skin of his cheek; an
angelic purity and a dove-like simplicity shone forth from his eye, which
showed at once the serene chastity of his soul."<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Such, in aspect, was
Bernard, the young saint, who, before many years had passed, was to be the
dominant force in the policies of western Europe.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Bernard's origin was not less worthy than that of his companions. His
father, Tescelin le Roux (the Red), could trace back his descent through the
chevaliers of old, to immemorial times. Born at Ch&acirc;tillon on Seine, he
belonged to the seigneurial family of that town, though he resided much at
his castle of Fontaines-les-Dijon, where Bernard was born, only a short
distance from the Burgundian capital. Tescelin's wife, Alethea, was
descended in direct line from the Counts of Montbard, and through them
was connected with the Dukes of Burgundy, in whose court, as counsellor of
Eudes I. and Hugues II., Tescelin was high in favour. He was a man of
honour, strong and firm of character; she, a girl of fifteen at the time of her
marriage, was of gentle disposition, sorrowing often because God had seen
fit to thwart her leanings towards the cloister life. As the mother of
Bernard, third of her seven children, a yet nobler destiny was reserved for
her. Shortly before the birth of this third child, there came to Alethea a
mysterious dream, in which she seemed to see, imprisoned within her own
body, a little red and white dog, who barked without ceasing. Astonished
and troubled by this vision, she consulted a priest, as to what it might mean.
His interpretation filled her heart with joy.</p>

<p>"Fear not," said he, "You are to become the mother of a marvellous child.
Like unto a faithful dog he will keep guard over the House of the Lord, and
shall make his cry heard against the enemies of the faith. He shall surpass
all other preachers, and his word, full of light and authority, shall be
the saving of many."<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The young child in every way fulfilled the heavenly promise; yet, for
many a year, he was torn mentally between the calls of the world and of the
cloister; both in his early training at the schools of Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Seine, and
later, when in spiritual solitude, at the ch&acirc;teau of Fontaines, he looked down
upon the dead body of his mother. The world would not yield, without a
struggle, so promising a recruit as Bernard, whose father, never dreaming
that the gates of the monastery were soon to close upon him too, was not
alone in his endeavours to keep his son from the religious life.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Bernard,
however, was proof against all persuasion; nor was it long before his fast-developing
strength of character and conviction caused him, in his turn, to
become the aggressor. One by one the brothers were won over, until, at
last, all, save G&eacute;rard, were upon Bernard's side. Resolute, he still turned
with indignation from all the young saint's proposals. Bernard laid his hand
upon his brother's side:</p>

<p>"I see," said he, "that misfortune alone can enlighten thee. A day is
coming, and it is not far off, when a lance shall pierce this body, and open,
towards the heart, an easy passage to the thought of salvation."</p>

<p>And so it came about; for some days later, at the siege of the castle
of Grancy, G&eacute;rard fell, struck by a lance; and, covered with blood, was
carried into the fortress prison. Then he recalled Bernard's saying, saw his
destiny clearly, and accepted the religious life.</p>

<p>Bernard's brothers were among the company who had knocked that day at
the gate of Citeaux. The new-comers remained for a week in the guest
house of the monastery. On the eighth day they were taken into the
chapter house, where the Abbot and his monks were assembled. As they
knelt before him, the Abbot put to each of them the question prescribed by
the rule:</p>

<p>"What seek you?" to which they replied in turn:</p>

<p>"My Father, God's Mercy, and yours." Then were read to them the
stricter points of the Cistercian rule, and the Abbot dismissed them saying,</p>

<p>"My sons; may God fulfil in you that which His Grace has begun."<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>From the commencement of his novitiate, Bernard practised austerities
that were severe&mdash;even for a Cistercian. He would kneel until, on rising,
his swollen limbs refused, almost, to support him, and, while always ready
with a helping hand to lighten the toil of other monks in the forest or the
marsh, he prepared himself for his labours with nourishment so poor that his
body wasted and fever consumed him, until his life was despaired of. Devoting
all his mind to the inward and spiritual, to answering well the question
he was always asking himself, "Bernarde ad quid venisti?" (Bernard,
wherefore art thou here?), he seems to have been almost unobservant of outward
things. The old chronicler relates how, one day, being thirsty, the
saint drank, without noticing its taste, (nihil sapiebat gustandi) a jar of oil
whose contents he had mistaken for water. On another occasion, when
asked whether the ceiling of his cell was flat or vaulted, he was quite unable
to answer.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The immediate result of the coming of such a man, with such companions,
was an enormous increase in the numbers and power of that order.
Postulates flocked in hundreds to the Abbey of Citeaux, and, by the year
1113, it had become necessary to establish daughter abbeys. The first was
La Fert&eacute; (Firmitas), so called to signify the strength and consistency that
the Almighty had already bestowed upon the rising order. Then followed
Pontigny, where Bernard's friend, Hugues de M&acirc;con, was sent as abbot;
then, in 1115, Morimond, and Clairvaux (Claire Vall&eacute;e)&mdash;once the robber-haunted
Valley of Wormwood. Before long, the order had the choice of
the fairest fields of France; indeed, of all Europe.</p>

<p>But Clairvaux had no abbot; and Citeaux must supply one. The choice
fell upon St. Bernard, twenty-five years of age, hardly out of his novitiate,
scarce able to support the exercise of his rule, and little fitted, as it seemed,
to undertake a voyage of discovery to the loneliest forest in all the diocese
of Langres. Yet he must go.</p>

<p>The form in which such an expedition set out was characteristic, and impressive
in its simplicity. The monks, having been assembled by sound of
the bell, all the community went down upon their knees. After a long
silence, the Abbot intoned a psalm; then, taking a cross of wood from the
altar, he handed it, as the token of office, to the new Abbot. The latter
received it in silence, kissed it, still without speaking, and left his stall,
followed by twelve other monks, symbols of the Christ and apostles. All
the brothers then ranged themselves in the cloister, while, with heads bowed,
the thirteen passed between them. Silently the gates of the monastery swung
open, revealing to all a glimpse of the dangerous world beyond. The pilgrims
filed out; and the clang of closing gates announced the termination
of the ceremony.</p>

<p>We have not space to follow further the career of the "Last of the
Fathers," as he was called, or to trace in detail the growth of an influence
so extraordinary, that about the year 1148, we find Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable,
Abbot of Cluny, writing of "Bernard of Clairvaux, the splendid and immovable
column that sustains not the monastic order only, but the entire
church," while Bernard himself, broken down by the weight of affairs pressing
upon him, writes to Eug&egrave;ne III: "People are pretending everywhere
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
that you are not pope, but I; and all who have business, flock to me for help,"
(Aiunt non vos esse papam, sed me). Geoffrey, Bernard's secretary and
successor, writing two years after his master's death, said: "Whoso has met
Bernard has seen Christ. For in him the whole Christ dwelt."<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Without, indeed, going so far in praise as did his secretary, we may agree
that Bernard's character comprised most of those elemental virtues, that,
blended, make the perfect man. In him, calmness and vehemence, tenderness
and serenity, tenacity and flexibility, vivid imagination and unswerving
rectitude, were all present; ever ready to meet the necessities of any occasion
that might arise. With all these varied gifts he never flattered, never
betrayed the truth, never dissembled the sacred ardour that burned within
him. Everywhere he was listened to with profound respect; his stern voice
was heard in the cottages of the poor, and in the palaces of kings. Neither
his enthusiasm, nor his ceaseless activities, caused him to lose lucidity nor
precision of argument in debate. His repartee was gentle and penetrating;
swift to disentangle truth from error, without practising the subtleties of the
schools. He was that rarest of phenomena, a practical idealist, an enlightened
fanatic. And with all these varied faculties, high above men of his time
though his intellect was, he remained ever a true son of the Church, nor
sought to free himself from the yoke of Catholic authority. Therein lay
the secret of his subsequent bitter antagonism to the teachings of Ab&eacute;lard.</p>

<p>A few words as to Cistercian ideals, and especially as to Cistercian rule,
as compared with that of Cluny, may not be out of place here.</p>

<p>For the sites of all their monasteries, they chose invariably lonely and wild
lands, marshy valleys, swamps, or lake, or forest, where the monks would be
under no temptation from the vicinity of worldly attractions, nor from too
close contact with the secular clergy, whose influence was sometimes harmful.
The Cistercian's first duty was the first duty of man&mdash;to reclaim the
dark places of the earth from watery desolation to culture and fertility; just
as, later on, the first duty of preaching friars was to win back the souls of
men, from the power of Satan unto God. Faurtride, third abbot of Clairvaux,
quotes St. Bernard as giving another reason. "It is not sufficient for
a monk to allege illness (as an excuse for shirking the austerities of the rule).</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The holy fathers, our predecessors, sought deep damp valleys for their
monasteries, so that the monks might be often ailing, and having death always
before their eyes, should never live in security."<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

  <p class="center font09">ST. JOHN, BURGUNDIAN SCHOOL</p>
</div>

<p>It may be well imagined, that an order founding its houses upon such
sites, and for such a reason, did not err upon the side of indulgence. The
rule was more strict, even, than that
followed by Cluny in early days, both
as regards abstinence from food and the
rigid enforcement of silence. Vegetables
were not to be served with fat or butter;
meat was absolutely forbidden, unless
sometimes to the sick; and fish, except
herrings during Advent and Lent, was
allowed only on rare occasions. When
Pope Innocent II. visited Clairvaux in
1131, the monks had a hard task to find
a single herring for his table. In the
matter of clothing, too, they were much
more simple than the Clunisians, and
closer to the Benedictine rule; for
instance, the gloves, boots, and furred
pelisses, permitted in the older abbey
during the winter, were forbidden to
monks of the rival order.</p>

<p>The whole secret of Citeaux's influence
may be summed up in two words&mdash;simplicity
and self-sacrifice. These
principles extended right through the life
of the order, even to its architecture and
to its art. Already, at the time of the
coming of St. Bernard, the Clunisians
were beginning to lighten with sculpture
the splendid severity of their Romanesque
buildings, to deck their statues with
precious stones, and with beautiful glass;
to adorn with gilding and voluptuous
colour the gray stones of aisle and nave.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Bernard, quick to see the danger, sent his masons back to the essential.
Nave and choir were to be of low elevation, and without towers; within
must be neither painting, nor sculpture, nor crucifix, nor colour, nor any
other ornament. Even the tympanum of the porch, so richly carved in
Clunisian churches, might show only a cross in bas-relief, sometimes surmounted
by the Lamb of God. Any sculpture in the interior must be confined
to simple flowers and foliage on the capitals, with perhaps a claw at the
base of the pillars; the apse and chapels were to be square, not polygonal nor
semi-circular, as in the work of the other school. Above all, the Cistercians
banished from their churches the scenes from the Ancient and New Testaments,
the symbolical figures and fantastic animals, of which the Clunisians
were so fond. Their cloisters were low and heavy, and the windows of the
monastic buildings were narrow, almost, as loopholes.</p>

<p>In ceremonial observances they were equally simple, and contented themselves
with a monotonous psalmody, poor and thin compared with the melodious
chants that rang down the aisles of Cluny. The manuscripts showed
the same scorn of art. Cluny bound their parchments beautifully in gold
and silver, and ornamented them with precious stones; Citeaux was content
with a rough binding of pig-skin, decorated with nails, and fastened with
copper bands.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that such vital difference of opinion should find contemporary
expression in words, as well as deeds. Bernard protests vehemently
against luxe. His correspondence on the subject with his friend,
Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable, is full of interest.</p>

<p>"I do not speak," he writes, "of the prodigious height of the churches,
of their immeasurable length, of their unnecessary width, of their
sumptuous ornaments, of their curious paintings, which draw the
glances of those who are at prayer, and prevent them from praying.
As a monk, I address myself to monks, and I say to them:
You who should be poor, what do you with this gold in the sanctuary?
Other than this should be the conduct of the bishops, other than
this that of the monks. The bishops, as we know, extend their solicitude to
the foolish as well as to the wise. That they should seek to arouse by
exterior ornament the devotion of a carnal people insensible to the ornaments
of the soul, we can well understand; but we who have come forth from the
bosom of this people, who, for the love of Christ, have left the world and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
all which is precious and apparent, we who regard as dung all that shines by
beauty, all that flatters the ear by harmony, that pleases the senses of smell
and touch, in a word, all that can give rise to sensual pleasure, whose devotion
do we aspire to arouse by these ornaments?</p>

<p>"And to speak my thought openly, is it not avarice, that idolatry of
slaves, which inspires us, and do we not seek rather the gifts of matter than
the fruits of the spirit? How so, will you reply? I will tell you. Gold
is lavished on every hand that it may multiply; it is spread abroad that it may
be augmented. At the sight of these sumptuous vanities which excite
astonishment, men feel themselves inflamed with the will to give, rather than
with the will to pray. I do not know what this penchant may be, that bids
us give more willingly to him that already has much. Eyes are dazzled
by reliquaries covered with gold, and the sight of them opens every purse.
The more the chasse shines in beauty, the more sacred are the relics held
to be. We hasten to kiss them, and we feel ourselves drawn on into giving;
we admire that which strikes the eye, rather than venerate holy things. In
the churches are exposed, not crowns, but wheels encrusted with pearls, and
the lamps which surround them cast a light less bright than the precious
stones. For candalabra, we see rise a tier of enormous weight, fashioned
with a marvellous art, which glitters less by the candles which surmount it,
than by the diamonds with which it is adorned.</p>

<p>"What seek ye in all that, I ask you; is it the compunction of penitence
or the astonishment of the eye? O Vanity of Vanities, O Folly! In her
buildings, the church is ashine, in her poor she is all impoverished. She
clothes her stones with gold, she leaves her children naked. 'Tis at the
expense of the poor that we seek to flatter the eye of the rich. The curious
find wherewithal to charm them; the unfortunate seek in vain their daily
bread. Do we not abuse our veneration of the images of the saints, until
they are ready to rise from the paving-stones? Here one is spitting in an
angel's mouth; there the passers-by tread upon the face of a saint. If you
do not respect these holy images, why do you not respect at least their
brilliant colouring? Of what use is it to decorate these figures if they are to
be continually soiled with dust? Of what use are they to the poor, to the
monks, to spiritual men?</p>

<p>"What is the meaning in the cloisters, before the brother occupied in
reading, of those ridiculous monsters, those deformed beauties, those beautiful
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
deformities? What do they there, those unclean apes, those fierce lions,
those monstrous centaurs, those figures half man, half beast, those striped
tigers, those fighting soldiers, those huntsmen who sound the horn? On
one side, I see many heads on a single body; on the other,
many bodies with a single head; here a beast with a serpent's tail;
there a fish with an animal's head. Half a horse ends in half a goat; a
horned animal bears a horse's croup. Everywhere appears a multitude of
varied and uncouth forms. More pleasure is taken in reading on marble
than in books; we choose rather to pass the whole day in looking upon these
pictures than in meditating upon the Divine Law. Great God, though we
blush not at such follies, let us blush, at least, at the sums they cost!"<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>However worthy such ideals might be from the spiritual point of view&mdash;and
no one, surely, can read Bernard's letter without feeling its power and
sincerity&mdash;it is obvious that, like those of the later Puritanism, they bore
within them the germs of their own destruction. No community of man,
even in those glorious days of the early middle ages, could live, for long, up
to that standard; and as the order established itself all over Europe, almost,
the diffusion of its forces resulted necessarily in a swift falling away, and
loss of prestige. That change, though, perhaps, a disaster for the Christian
church, was the salvation of Western Europe; for, had the ideals of Citeaux
finally prevailed over those of Cluny, the glorious Gothic arts of the next
three centuries, upon which Cluny certainly exercised great influence&mdash;of
which, indeed, she was the mother&mdash;would not have attained the same
development.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the distinguished visitors to Citeaux, were Louis le Gros, in 1127;
Pope Eug&egrave;ne III., who presided over the chapter general, in 1148;
Louis VII., in 1166; and Louis IX. (St. Louis), who came here from
V&eacute;zelay, in 1244.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>On that occasion, according to custom, the Duke of Burgundy,
Hugues IV., preceded the royal cort&egrave;ge up to the limit of his lands. As
they approached Citeaux, coming in sight of the church, all left their horses,
and advanced on foot in the attitude of prayer. The prelates, the abbots
who were there, and the monks, to the number of five hundred, came forth
in procession to welcome the monarch visiting them for the first time.
Louis IX. and Queen Blanche did not lodge in the abbey, but in the Hotel
du Duc de Bourgogne, without the walls. They were specially authorized
to eat meat during their stay, on condition that such permission would not
be granted on a future occasion.<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Upon the fair fame of the later history of the order there rests one
indelible stain. Citeaux was largely responsible for that series of awful
crimes and massacres known as the Albigensian crusade. Early in the
thirteenth century, Innocent III., weary of vain attempts by spiritual force
to crush out heresy from the church, decided to employ the not unwilling
Cistercians to preach a new crusade. A great army of "Crusaders," under
the command of Eudes III., Duke of Burgundy, crossed the Rh&ocirc;ne at
Avignon, and passing through Montpellier, came to B&eacute;ziers, where they proceeded
to indulge in "the greatest massacre ever committed in all the
world; for they spared neither young nor old, nor even infants at the breast."
It seems a cruel irony that from Arnaud, Abbot of Citeaux, a successor of St.
Robert and St. Bernard, should have come the answer to the question how
they were to deal with the heretics: "Kill them all; God will know His
Own!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But happier recollections than those were in my mind when last I rode
to Citeaux from Dijon, on a dull and rainy morning of October, a fitting
day on which to visit that savage and lonely site. There are people&mdash;cultured
people, even, such as Emile Mont&eacute;gut&mdash;who will tell you that,
because the country here is flat, and the old monastery almost entirely
destroyed, Citeaux is not worthy of a visit. I find it hard to understand how
anyone possessing a spark of historic imagination, can thus deprive himself
of the pleasure of seeing the abbey; though there were certainly less
inducement to go there when the place was a penitentiary school, than now,
when it is again in the occupation of the white monks. I hope that this
account of my own pilgrimage there will induce others to follow my
example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>I rode to Citeaux by way of Rouvres, a lonely village on the plain south
of Dijon. It has, or had, a ch&acirc;teau&mdash;not now visible within its belt of
trees&mdash;that has some interesting historical associations, and there is a Romanesque
church accessible, I remember, by a somewhat unique bridge, consisting
of gravestones, evidently taken from the churchyard, laid, with the
inscriptions uppermost, across the stream where the ducks paddle.</p>

<p>Passing through many a tangled and dilapidated Burgundian village, I
came at last, after miles of plodding across the plain, to a spot so savage of
aspect, that it might well be a halting-place, even to-day, for an ascetic
brotherhood faring forth in search of a site for a new foundation. On
the left of the lonely road was a stagnant marsh, bordered with clumps of
yellow reeds and brown bullrushes. Before me, a great expanse of sullen
water, fringed with a line of distant, black fir trees, reflected on its broken
surface the drifting, gray clouds. A dismal lake it was, marged with red and
green rushes, dappled with broad-leaved water plants, and spotted with
splashing drops. No human note broke the silence; no sound but the harsh
cry of wild fowl, the croaking of frogs, the monotonous swish of falling rain.
At my feet were growing thistles and deadly night-shade; through the reeds
I caught a glimpse of a pink sow snouting in the mud. A feeling of intense
exaltation arose within me&mdash;the delight born of unity with Nature in her
elemental mood. I knew now why the Cistercians loved these spots.
There welled up in me the same sensation of burning pleasure that lightened
the life of the ascetic of eight hundred years ago, when, leaning upon the
handle of his spade, as he paused for a moment from his labour, he watched
the wind furrowing the rippled water, and heard the holy spirits of the air
singing to the bending rushes on the bank.</p>

<p>I rode on, past the gateway of the Abbey grounds, to the village of Citeaux,
where I lunched with an asceticism that, though not inappropriate to the
occasion, was due, I must confess, rather to the limitations of the innkeeper's
resources, than to a voluntary compliance with the rule of St. Benedict.
During the repast, Madame, standing before me, and punctuating her
remarks with an occasional sweep of the back of her hand across her mouth,
held forth upon the history of the Abbey. Learning from her that the
buildings could be visited, I determined to see what was to be seen.
Cycling boldly up to the gate of the monastery, and ignoring utterly a
mighty hound, who nearly strangled himself in his efforts to rend me limb
from limb, I looked about me. Near the gate was a white monk, walking
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
slowly, with his eyes upon the ground. He bowed in response to my salutation;
but, when he raised his head, his hesitation, and the spasmodic movements
of his lips before he spoke, betrayed the effect of the rule of silence.
The words came with an effort.</p>

<p>"Vous n'avez qu'&agrave; sonner &agrave; la porte."</p>

<p>I rang the bell accordingly, when there emerged, from the lodge opposite
to the gate, another little, square-headed, white-robed monk, who, smiling,
and bowing low, with spread hands, welcomed me to the monastery.</p>

<p>My guide was an intelligent, affectionate, resigned little Flamand, his
natural cheerfulness of disposition tempered by the inevitable sadness of a
vocation now generally despised, and quite apart from the swiftly-flowing
current of modern life. Together we traversed the rooms and corridors of
the modern buildings&mdash;until recently a penitentiary school&mdash;from which the
members of the chapter, held annually in September, had departed only the
day before my visit. On the walls of the assembly room were plans of the
four daughter abbeys of Citeaux&mdash;La Fert&eacute;, Pontigny, Clairvaux, and
Morimond; "Une m&egrave;re bien f&eacute;conde," as my guide said&mdash;and the signed
letter of Pope Leo XIII., restoring Citeaux to the Cistercian order. The
chapter table, round which ran the names of the abbeys represented, was
still littered with pens and ink for use at the function. My monk pointed
out the little ballot-box, filled with white beans, by means of which the voting
was done. A majority of one carries the day, and the ballot is open, unless
one member expresses a desire for it to be secret. The rule of St. Benedict,
and the book of the constitutions, are kept on the table for reference, if
necessary.</p>

<p>We passed beneath the bust of St. Bernard, which is over the door, and
descended to the foot of the stairs, where my companion put on again, over
his sandalled feet, the sabots he had kicked off on entering. A moment
later we were standing in the refectory, where, upon the table, were laid
the spoons, the brown earthenware plates, the bowls and the napkins, all
ready for the next meal. The abbot sits, as of old, at the head of his twenty-five
monks, and in the middle is a table with three "couverts," where the
same vegetarian repast is served to three souls in purgatory, the remains being
given to the poor. Thence, I was taken to see the little cloister, the staircase
tower and library, probably of the fourteenth century, all that remains
of the great Abbey. On the way we passed through the garden, where a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
dozen or more black and white-robed brethren were busily digging the
ground, still carrying on the tradition of St. Benedict, that in the sweat of
their brow they should eat bread. That sight alone repaid well the trouble
of coming to Citeaux in the rain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my gentle guide talked resignedly of the ruin of the building,
of the decay of the order. There was a note of deep sadness in his voice,
as he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_126.jpg" width="140" height="258" alt="Justice and Truth" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Justice and truth are like the sun; they
traverse the earth; they set."</p>

<p>"They rise again on the other side," I
added. A smile lit up the peaceful, flamand
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, they rise again on the other side."</p>

<p>We were at the gate.</p>

<p>"How I wish my wife had been here," I
said, thoughtlessly. "She would so have
enjoyed talking with you."</p>

<p>The little monk smiled, twinkled almost.
Here was an artless stranger, indeed!</p>

<p>"Monsieur," shaking his head, "We do
not allow ladies to pass the gate." It was
my turn to smile, and to apologise. My
friend guide understood. He took my hand.</p>

<p>"Probably," he murmured, "we meet no
more in this world. Then, adieu."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Again he bowed low, with spread hands.
The iron gate of Citeaux clanged behind
me; I was out in the living world once
more. As I rode to Nuits in the rain, between the dripping trees of the
ancient forest, whose glades had echoed to the foot-fall of St. Bernard, I felt,
more strongly than ever before, how close is the rapport existing between
the ascetic mysticism of that time&mdash;symbolising the soul of things in saint
and hermit&mdash;and the wider transcendentalism of to-day, that, taking, as Bacon
took, the all for its medium, works, through art, through science, through
poetry, through even subtler and more recondite communion of the human
spirit with fellow spirits and with nature, towards the ultimate goal of truth.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The country, as one travels from Cluny to Paray-le Monial, is varied and
interesting&mdash;so were the other passengers. At Charolles, there entered our
compartment two priests, one of whom devoted himself to his book, while the
other, a very tall, spare ecclesiastic, divided his time evenly between his
breviary, the sign of the cross, and a close scrutiny of my wife. Whether
there was any connection in his mind between the last two occupations, I am
unable to determine.</p>

<p>This little incident was sufficient to remind us that Paray&mdash;as the adjunct
Le Monial implies&mdash;is a town of ecclesiastical origin and tradition. It was,
in fact, a daughter of Cluny, an annexe of the maison abbatiale, and a place
of rest and of vill&eacute;giature for the abbots, who had their country seat here.
To-day it is the centre of the cult of the Sacr&eacute; C&oelig;ur, and a favourite place of
pilgrimage for the French peasantry of the district.</p>

<p>On arrival at the station, while I was engaged with the luggage, a straw-hatted
individual, who had been lounging about in the company of a young
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
woman, drew my wife's attention to the fact that there was no "plaque" on
our bicycles. On being referred to me, he demanded my permit, which I
naturally refused to exhibit, until he had proved his authority to ask for it.
He then produced, from his pocket-book, a printed paper, which appeared to
be the document required. I showed my permit accordingly; whereupon,
with a satirical smile, and the remark, "Une simple formalit&eacute;, Monsieur,"
the insuppressible strolled off. Insolent officialism is one of the "d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ments"
of France, to which a few more years of democratic supremacy will
probably expose this country also. A breach of that "simple formalit&eacute;," as
he called it, would inevitably have brought me to the sub-prefecture, and
would have cost me thirty francs and costs, for each machine. Let cyclists
in France see that they comply with all "simples formalit&eacute;s."</p>

<p>Setting out in the morning to explore Paray, we had corroborative
evidence of an impression already formed, concerning the manners&mdash;or want
of them&mdash;of many Burgundians. Two or three groups of young girls,
passing us in the streets, burst into shrieks of laughter under our very
noses; and a band of school children, who intercepted and surrounded us at
a corner shop, in a narrow lane, could not have shown deeper interest had
we been two teddy bears, or a Punch and Judy show. They made the
street absolutely impassable; we could not move until the shop-keeper
emerged, and drove them away.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_128.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="Two Priests" title="" />
</div>

<p>Modesty compels me to add that my wife was always the chief cause of
this hilarity and interest. These public attentions made her so uneasy that
she asked me plaintively, on one occasion, whether she had grown a hump in
the night! Though able to reassure her upon that point, I could not, nor
can I at this moment, satisfactorily account
for the undisguised astonishment her appearance
caused; but I lean to the conclusion
that the secret lay mainly in her clothes.
My wife was dressed&mdash;quite simply&mdash;but she
was dressed; whereas the women of Burgundy
merely wore clothes; garments that
bore no relation to each other, nor to the
individuality of the wearer. The directors
of the Grands Magazins du Louvre have much to answer for in
these matters, and it was positively refreshing, in the remoter parts of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
country, to see the village women, naturally dressed, walking like goddesses,
freely, and in the shape in which Nature made them.</p>

<p>But to return from flesh and blood to the stones of Paray. Her old
monuments, though few, are choice. The best of them, excepting the
church, is the Hotel de Ville, a building with an exquisite Renaissance
fa&ccedil;ade, beautifully harmonized, showing Italian influence, and dating from
1525. The flatness of the elevation is relieved, and the whole bound together
vertically, by three half-round turrets, which spring from corbels
below the sill strings of the first floor windows. Three moulded courses
ornamented with heads and busts in medallion,<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and panels in relief, extend
right across the building, below the windows. Several of the heads,
including that of Francis I., are still recognizable portraits. Between the
windows, and beside the turrets, are decorative, sculptured pilasters. There
are many figures in niches, and a profusion of scallop-shell ornament, all
showing the transitional character of the work. The top story, with alternating
turrets, and gables surmounted by statuettes, is extremely effective. All
the windows are beautifully proportioned, and finely, though not deeply,
moulded. As a whole, weathered by time to a rich, warm brown, this is
one of the most effective fa&ccedil;ades of its kind that I know in France.</p>

<p>The interior, which might easily be restored, has been spoiled by whitewashing
the oak beams of ceilings that shelter many exhibits, of little interest,
excepting some nice tiles from the old house. This was built by a rich
cloth manufacturer, Pierre Jayet, from 1525-1528. According to Mont&eacute;gut,
Pierre's brother was so jealous of the beauty of the building, that he
determined to eclipse it; and accordingly erected the church of St. Nicholas,
which, with the later tower of that name (1658), still stands opposite to the
Hotel de Ville. If the date of the Church, as given to me, namely 1505,
is correct, the legend must be without foundation; but, whether it be true
or false, that lovely fa&ccedil;ade has nothing to fear from comparison with any
other building in the town.</p>

<p>Paray-le Monial's church is a splendid and typical example of the
Clunisian school of Burgundian architecture, about contemporary with the
Cathedral of Autun. In fact, you have only to create, in imagination, a
longer nave, transeptal towers, a second transept, and flying buttresses, to
form a very good idea of the appearance of Cluny abbey in the middle ages.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>From the eastern end you get the typical Burgundian effect of a series of
apsidal chapels and collaterals, lifting the eye, stage by stage, up to the
central clock tower, and thus conveying an impression of dependent solidity
unique in architecture, and quite symbolical of Burgundian character.
The apsidal chapels are buttressed by engaged columns, and lightened by a
string, ornamented with a billet, run right round, to form the drip-stones and
the abaci of the capitals, some of which are very beautiful.</p>

<p>'Tis sad that Cluny's fair daughter is content to keep such ill company.
The approach to, and view of, the church from the north, is almost completely
blocked out by hideous booths filled with tawdry trinkets, by a
"Diorama Mus&eacute;e," and other mean erections, which should be ruthlessly
swept away by the authorities. Visitors may be annoyed, too, as we were,
by the attentions of an imbecile woman, employed by the hangers-on
of the church, to fetch water and run errands for them. She looked over
my shoulder diligently while I took notes, and only replied with a wild stare,
and a "Rien, rien," to my request to know what I could do for her. A few
yards further on, we came upon the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>On reading this effusion, our first impression was, that there must be some
mental affinity between the dreadful woman who had just been jibbering at
us, and the promoters of this novel entertainment; until we realized that the
wax-works were merely another catch-penny, aimed at pilgrims' pockets&mdash;the
invitation I had just read being no more than a weak attempt to rope in
an occasional English enthusiast. The discovery, not far off, of a similar
legend, written in bad German, revealed the origin of the "Nusstree." It
is curious how seldom French attempts to break out publicly into the English
tongue, meet with any degree of success. From the "High Life Tailor"
of Parisian boulevards, to the "Nusstree" of Paray-le Monial, it is always
the same story; one English word is as good as another to a Frenchman who
understands neither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>The north door of the church, flanked though it be by disreputable buildings,
is a graceful construction, of somewhat unusual classical design,
well harmonized and proportioned, and exquisitely carved. All the sculpture,
from the flowered architrave within the pilasters, to the ornamentation
of the shafts and the shouldered arches, is very pleasing, as are the doors
themselves, with their quatre-foiled iron ornament, surrounding an inner
cross.</p>

<p>The primitive porch, and the western towers of the church are somewhat
remarkable. Murray, on what authority I cannot say, puts their date at
1004, but Viollet-le-Duc contents himself with admitting this portion to be
earlier than the remainder of the Church. The northern tower is the later
of the two. The porch is arched, and of two bays, forming six quadripartite
vaults between the arches. The weight of the towers above was originally
taken by two central clusters of stone columns, which proved quite inadequate
for the purpose, and were replaced&mdash;in the 19th century, I think&mdash;by
a granite column.<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The western precincts of the Church exhibit the usual
signs of decadence of ecclesiastical power and influence. Dead leaves littering
the porch, mercifully screen the "choses immondes" and the building
materials with which the floor is scattered; and as though the building were
not yet sufficiently defiled, a board invites the public to deposit its rubbish
between the porch and the river, on a site at present in the occupation of
noisy children.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Seen from within, the church is noble and impressive; but the eye at
once notices a want of proportion; the height of the first storey being too
great for that of the triforium and clerestories. This is due, in part, to the
shortness of the nave, which might be three times as long, and, in part, to
the flatness of the triforium, a true blind-story, rendered mean for lack of
shadow to break up the flatness of the arcades. The supports for the
vaulting take the form of fluted pilasters, which rise to the capitals, on a
level with the sill string, below the triforium; whence the thrust is taken
by half round vaulting shafts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Here, as elsewhere in Burgundy and
Southern France, the pointed arch is obviously used as a necessity of construction,
rather than for any inherent love the builders bore it. Before the
art of buttressing had developed, no other method was open to them.<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Grateful memories still linger of that vista&mdash;down the wide-aisled
nave to the well-proportioned columns of the apse, bathed in rich
colours from the stained glass, which, modern though it be, is
worthy, when compared with our recollections of Notre Dame de Cluny.
The interior has not many decorative features, except the fluted pilasters, and
the archivolts, somewhat in the Lombard style, in which the lozenge and the
billet ornament are effectively used. Very local, on the contrary, and very
characteristic are the Byzantine beasts carved among the foliage on the
capitals of the ambulatory.</p>

<p>'Tis a pity that the crossings are so prominent; their nudity enhances the
ill-effect of the debauch of whitewash that renders the interior so cold. One
of the few good monuments is a fifteenth-century, south-eastern, transeptal
chapel, with the remains of the gothic canopied tomb of the Seigneurs of
Digoin. The windows, doors and niches of the chapel are satisfactory, but
the ribbed vaulting is clumsy, and much too heavy for so small a roof. I
believe that the figures are all modern.</p>

<p>As we left by the north transept, we noticed a lady standing before the
statue of St. Peter. Rising upon her toes until her bonnet feathers nodded,
she was just able, with an effort, to kiss the toe of the Saint. I examined
that toe; it was bright with the salutes of the faithful.</p>

<p>Nowhere do I remember to have seen so many appeals and warnings
against blasphemy and desecration as are displayed in the church of Paray.
No doubt they are needful and salutary; but it struck us, that, before enforcing
too severely their observance, the ecclesiastical authorities would do well
to set their own house in order, and, once for all, to sweep the precincts of
their basilica clear of all rubbish, human and inanimate, that now defiles it.
I wonder, sometimes, whether those who are responsible for the condition of
affairs at Paray, and other great French churches, have ever seen the close of
Salisbury, or of Wells, or can ever have realized how enhancing to the
dignity and grandeur of medi&aelig;val architecture, and how seemly, as settings to
a sacred building, are the delicious haunts of peace, upon whose trim, green
lawns and ancestral elms, those ancient cathedrals look down. That, having
done so, they can be content to let the towers of Paray rise from among
tawdry booths and a howling wilderness of filth and d&eacute;bris, is something I
do not care to believe. That is why, having visited in hope Cluny's lovely
daughter, we left her with little other feeling than one of sadness that such
things should be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The country around Paray is not particularly interesting; but some fine
views of the Church are to be had from the other side of the Bourbince.
Having set forth on bicycles to explore the land, we halted on a little bridge
that crosses the Canal du Centre. The waterway was lined, on our side,
for about a hundred yards, with small tumble-down cottages and sheds. The
other bank was alive with washerwomen all thumping mercilessly at soapy
garments. As we appeared, the thumping ceased. Every scrubbing-brush
was put down, or remained poised in mid-air, and all eyes turned towards
the two figures, who, even at that distance, bore the stamp of aliens.</p>

<p>We approached a cottage labelled "Caf&eacute;." Before it was a perambulator
containing a howling baby, whom a very serious little maid of about fourteen
was trying unsuccessfully to hush. We sat down on a rickety bench,
and ordered things. The little maid was so shy that her lips refused to part;
but her ears were open; she fetched and carried willingly, though dumbly.
We sat sipping, and contemplating nature. The washers returned to their
thumping; the baby howled.</p>

<p>Presently a lanky mule, into whom the spirit of devilment had entered,
broke from a neighbouring shed, and made for the bridge. The girl left her
charge, and endeavoured to "shoo" the beast to his stall again. He would
neither be coerced nor cajoled, but, with a wicked gleam in his eye, turned
his back upon her blandishments, and, to the great peril of the baby, lashed
out fiercely with both heels. The girl rushed to the perambulator. Conscious
of victory, the ass lay down upon the towing path, and rolled and
kicked, until the washers across the water were screened from us by clouds
of dust. Then, in due season, he arose and walked quietly back to his
stable. As my wife observed: "He is a very young mule; and there is no
fun in being naughty, if nobody minds."</p>

<p>A moment later, we saw coming towards us with swinging strides over
the bridge, a tall, swarthy, handsome figure, dressed as a stage bandit, in
copper-coloured leather coat, of the same tint as his face, a dark slouch hat,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and black leather gaiters. From each capacious side pocket projected the
neck of a large, white-glass, wine bottle. He called for a drink, and sat
down near us on a bench before the caf&eacute;; then, removing one of the bottles
from his coat, he revealed two snakes wriggling within it. Holding the
bottle by the neck, he shook it before the eyes of the howling baby, who
promptly fell into such strong convulsions that my wife feared for its life.</p>

<p>"What are those?" I asked, pointing to the bottle.</p>

<p>"Vipers," said the bandit, "'Tis my trade." Diving into the coat again,
he produced a metal armlet inscribed "Charmeur de Vip&egrave;res." Thence
followed, one by one, all his certificates of efficiency, signed by the mayors
of places in the neighbourhood&mdash;Digoin, M&acirc;con, and Paray. Here were
forty-six killed in one day; thirty-five more in the woods of Charolles; "Et
il y en a encore." He did not stay long enough for us to question him
concerning his methods of procedure; but, rising abruptly from the wooden
bench, strode off, a great, bronzed figure, and was soon lost among the
coppery tints of the Burgundian forest.</p>

<p>I have often wondered since, whether he worked solely by close observation,
or whether he had developed that supernormal or subnormal faculty,
withheld from most, but granted often to undeveloped minds, as it was to the
boy in Rollinat's song:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>


<p class="p2">To the outward eye Chalon-Sur-Sa&ocirc;ne is no more than a thriving,
modern, commercial town, containing little of interest to the antiquarian;
though the stir of life on the busy wharves may prove enticing to those who
weary, sometimes, of the sleepiness of country towns, and the faded glories
of medi&aelig;val cities. Yet, for our part, especially when we are in France, we
prefer the shadows of the past to the realities of the present; and, no sooner
were we in Ch&acirc;lon, than we set ourselves to picturing the town as it had
been, when the river was the scene of royal pageants, when three golden
bands girdled the city walls, and great tournaments were held on the island
where bold knights laid lance in rest round the banner of La Dame des
Pleurs.</p>

<p>One of the last of the river pageants was in 1371, when the Duke of
Anjou gave rendez-vous to Philippe le Hardi, his brother, at the papal city of
Avignon. The Duke embarked at Ch&acirc;lon with a great suite. In the first
vessel was Philip and his principal barons; then came the Chancellor's boat,
with other nobles; then the barges of the kitchen, the wardrobe, the wine-cellar,
and the fish store. The Duke appeared with great &eacute;clat at Avignon,
and offered the pope a courser, a hackney, two flagons, and two basins of
silver-gilt. He also dealt so generously with the cardinals, that, to enable
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
him to return, he was obliged to pawn his jewels with a Lombard, as security
for a loan of twenty thousand francs.<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>But I want now to go back to earlier days, even, than those&mdash;to the year
589, when Gontran was king of Burgundy, and had his court at Ch&acirc;lon&mdash;whenever
his wars with Childebert and Chilperic allowed him to hold court
anywhere. Gontran, it was, who, twelve years before, in 577, had founded
two miles away eastward, in the plain, a great abbey in honour of St. Marcel,
the apostle of the Ch&acirc;lonnais, martyred upon that very spot. Gontran too,
it was, who rebuilt the walls of Ch&acirc;lon, broken down by the Huns, and
ornamented them, for a belt, with three bands of golden stone; so that, in
after years, the early historians and the poets, singing of the city by the
Sa&ocirc;ne, hailed it as Orbandale, the town "aux bandelettes d'or." That is
why, to-day, the arms of Ch&acirc;lon are three golden circles, two and one, on
a field of azure.</p>

<p>I am going to tell here, briefly, the story of Bertille, the heroine of the
golden bands&mdash;surnamed, not too happily, La Judith Ch&acirc;lonnaise.<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In the year 589, there dwelt in the royal city of Ch&acirc;lon, a worthy man,
Vulfrand by name, and his wife, Ludwige. They had a daughter, Bertille,
supple, graceful, dignified, and so lovely and virtuous, that she was the pride,
not of her parents only, but of all the town, famous though it then was for
producing beautiful women. Bertille was nearly seventeen years old, and
she had been brought up in the Christian faith, at a time when that religion,
then still young, needed every proselyte it could win. And she was her
parents' only child.</p>

<p>One summer evening, after Bertille had read aloud the vesper prayer, her
father, having made the sign of the cross upon his brow, rose, and went to
the door of the apartment, which opened upon the street. Standing upon
the threshold, he was enjoying the freshness of the twilight air, when
suddenly he was aware of a commotion in the neighbouring street&mdash;the stir
of a great crowd, men's voices, and the clatter of horses' hoofs.</p>

<p>"Bertille!" he called, "Come, come quickly, or you will be too late!"
And, indeed, already there drew near a great cort&egrave;ge, ecclesiastics for the
most part, proceeding in some dis-array, and hastening, because of the late
hour, and the distance they had yet to go.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>King Gontran had convoked a council in the church of St. Marcel&mdash;the
town then named Hobiliacus&mdash;and thither this cort&egrave;ge of bishops and priests
was bent, eager to arrive before nightfall, that they might begin their conference
early the next morning.</p>

<p>Bertille came to the door just as the last members of the cort&egrave;ge were
passing. Among them was a rider whose costume showed plainly that he
was no ecclesiastic. From the scutcheon embroidered upon the front of his
garment, he appeared to be a noble&mdash;lord, perhaps, of some neighbouring
kingdom. His steed was rearing; and he, not averse from showing to the
crowd his strength and skill in horsemanship, let it plunge at its will. Then
he reined it in, and was looking proudly around him at the moment when
Bertille ran to the door. His eyes rested upon her, in a fixed gaze. Bertille
felt the stare; and shuddered before it.</p>

<p>"Father, that horseman is not following the cort&egrave;ge," said the girl, blushing
and hiding her head behind Vulfrand's shoulder. "Let us go in," she
added, "I have seen enough."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, ma belle, are you feeling ill?"</p>

<p>"No, but that lord's stare has tired me."</p>

<p>"And reddened you, too, little angel of Paradise! But in with you!
though there's small harm in being seen; even when one is as pretty as you."
He kissed her forehead, smiling, and together they went in. They told the
mother what had chanced. "His eyes," said Bertille, "were upon me like
a serpent's upon a bird."</p>

<p>Night fell, and with it came the hour of sleep.</p>

<p>"Allons!" said Vulfrand, "Good night, my Bertille; sleep well, and above
all, forget the eye of that serpent."</p>

<p>"If only you were there, to put your foot on his head," said she, smiling,
to her father.</p>

<p>"Oh! you are no big girl, are you?&mdash;no more than the little bird was a
big bird. Go to bed; sleep, dream of him, and crush him under your own
heel." Half an hour later, Bertille was asleep.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young horseman in question, Amalon by name, a Duke
in rank, from the country of Champagne, charged with the conduct of
negotiations at the court of Burgundy, was following the cort&egrave;ge of ecclesiastics,
with whom he must attend to-morrow's council at St. Marcel. But,
ever, as he rode, the beautiful face of Bertille shining before his eyes, awoke
evil thoughts within him. He soon decided that so fair a maid was better
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
worth his attention, than a discussion with the bishops concerning the goods
of the church. So, after waiting until the boats had carried the learned
company across the Sa&ocirc;ne, he returned to his own apartment, preoccupied,
and with his heart beating rather faster than was its wont.</p>

<p>"Surely the girl is very fair," he said to himself, "and well worth a little
trouble. These are quiet days in my town of Troyes; and who knows but
the name of Duchess may tickle her ears." Then he, too, slept.</p>

<p>The next day, the Duke Amalon, faring forth earlier than was his custom,
chanced to meet Bertille in the street, as she was going forth to do
marketing for the household. Making her a low obeisance, he accosted the
maid, told her who he was, and how her charms had brought him, at one
glance, to her feet. But, to his great surprise, he found that neither the
magic title of Duke, nor of Duchess, even, wrought favourably with the
girl. On the contrary, her dark eyes showed only fear and resentment,
until, taking advantage of the protection afforded by passers-by, she turned
swiftly and fled from him, homeward.</p>

<p>"Fly away, shy dove," hissed the young lord between his teeth. "None
the less there shall be good bird-nesting to-morrow."</p>

<p>A week later, Duke Amalon sat at the board. He was sick at heart, his
proud face aflame with wine and anger. Messengers were announced, and
there entered to him the five servants he had left behind at Ch&acirc;lon.</p>

<p>"You have been longer than long enough," he growled at them, "Ere
now I would have caught her six times over."</p>

<p>"She did not quit the house until this morning, Prince, and 'tis a day's
journey twixt there and here."</p>

<p>"'Tis well enough, for this time," said he, relenting somewhat. "Bring
in the shy dove." And he threw them a purse of gold. As they withdrew,
Amalon retired into a far corner of the apartment. The valets led into the
room Bertille, pale as the morn, and trembling, her hand upon her breast.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she cried. "Mother of God, whither hast thou let them
bring me?" And her beautiful, terrified eyes searched the room. They
lighted upon the dark face of the Duke.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, and uttering a piercing scream, fell upon her knees.</p>

<p>"Well, shy bird; are you still so little fain to become the lady of fair
Champagne?" And he drew near to her. The girl raised her eyes. "Do
not come near to me," she whispered, and turned away her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, listen to reason, little one. A duchy for your beaux yeux;
sooth! tis not too much; yet, for all that, be not too exacting." He laid
his fingers under the chin of the kneeling girl. Shuddering, Bertille sprang
to her feet; his touch had aroused anger, and, with anger, courage. She
turned from him, the red lips blanching, so firmly were they set.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not fly my sight, wild dove."</p>

<p>"The dove flies the serpent's gaze," she replied. Amalon made a step
nearer. She heard the foot-fall, and could not restrain a little cry, that was
half appeal, half prayer. As she prayed, her eye caught the glint of something
shining upon the wall opposite. That cry irritated the lord. His
sensual face grew darker.</p>

<p>"Cry on," he scoffed; "Walls hear naught; and my men without hear only
my voice." With a sob, she flung herself on her knees before him.</p>

<p>"Pity! lord duke, pity! for my parents' sake. Soil not your honour, nor
mine; yield a frail girl to her mother again. Already she has wept long for
me." Then, as she humbled her beauty before him, and her long, black hair,
dishevelled, swept his very feet, strong passion burnt out all pity from
Amalon's heart. He bent low, and took her in his arms. With a wild cry,
the girl broke from his grasp, and rushed to the thing shining on the wall.
Cursing, the duke followed her. As he reached her, she turned.</p>

<p>"Serpent, feel how the dove can peck!" Torchlight flashed bright upon
the uplifted blade. There came the sound of a blow, an awful cry, and
Duke Amalon, his skull cloven, lay prostrate at the feet of the maid.</p>

<p>With a crash, the doors flew open; five poniards were raised over Bertille's
head. The Duke saw them, before darkness swam into his dying eyes.</p>

<p>"Slay her not," he whispered, "Slay her not, but let her go. This is
God's hand; so should virtue strike." He shuddered in every limb; then lay
still in death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The great council at St. Marcel was nearing its end. Already King
Gontran had withdrawn to his private apartments, and the fathers were
deeply occupied with the last session of the conference. The voice of the
speaker was filling the vast nave, and all were rapt in the closest attention,
when suddenly the door of the church was seen to open swiftly, and a figure,
heedless of the guardian's stern warning, entered the church, and ran down
the nave towards the choir. At the barrier behind which the conference was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
assembled, the new-comer knelt; and the astonished prelates saw before them
a young girl, weary and travel-stained, whose disordered dress and dishevelled
hair could not conceal her natural beauty.</p>

<p>Crossing her hands upon her breast, she looked upwards.</p>

<p>"Mother of Christ! it was to keep me still worthy of thee!"</p>

<p>The priest, who had been addressing the conference, stood silent. Every
eye was fastened upon the maid. The ecclesiastics gathered round her,
putting questions.</p>

<p>"My fathers, I have but one boon to ask of you. Deign to take me to
the king. It is with him that I would speak." So the fathers brought her
to the king's presence, within the monastery. The Prince received her
kindly; but Bertille hesitated, her beautiful eyes downcast.</p>

<p>"Speak," said Gontran, smiling; "A maid as fair as you are has little to
fear."</p>

<p>"Prince," replied the young girl, "I know not how it may have pleased
God to fashion me; but if it be, indeed, beauty that He has given me&mdash;then
is beauty a fatal gift?"</p>

<p>"How so?" said the King, with rising interest. The girl stood silent.
She reddened, and bent her head still lower. Her breast heaved, and the
tears flowed down.</p>

<p>"Prince," she said in broken tones, "I am ... guilty ... and I
come to yield myself into your hands." All eyes looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Guilty, my child, you!" said Gontran, not less amazed than the others.
"That is not easily believed."</p>

<p>"Yet it is true, Prince; and the proof is, that for three days I have seen
neither father nor mother."</p>

<p>"And where are your parents?"</p>

<p>"At Ch&acirc;lon."</p>

<p>"And why have you not seen them for so long?"</p>

<p>"I dared not return to them. Look, Prince, look!" She loosened a fold
of her dress; and there, plain for all to see, was a large, red, stain.</p>

<p>"Blood!" cried Gontran.</p>

<p>"Blood, my King!" Then the girl told all her tale. As they heard it,
indignation, writ at first upon every face, gave way to nods and smiles, and
murmurs of applause scarce restrained, when the end came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"No criminal here, holy fathers, methinks; but rather a heroine!" said
Gontran. Then, turning to the maid, he added:</p>

<p>"You hold yourself guilty; but, meseems you have been guided rather by
the Hand of God. Was the widow of Bethulie guilty when she delivered
her people? Yet, in my thought, your maiden modesty and fear rank you
above even that noble Judith. Be comforted then; to-morrow you shall see
your parents again. Now, go to rest; and God have you in His care this
night." So they made ready a chamber for Bertille; and there she slept, and
that right soundly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the next day, Gontran sent secretly to Ch&acirc;lon certain servants, with
commands to bring the parents of Bertille to his presence. The good people
were much terrified, and refused, at first, to follow the king's men, saying
that the loss of their daughter had stricken them so deep in sorrow, that they
would go no whither for no man&mdash;even though he be their own beloved
king, Gontran. But at length they let themselves be persuaded, and went&mdash;not
without fearful questioning as to what their lord the king might want
with such simple folk as they.</p>

<p>So they came before the king at the monastery of St. Marcel, and Gontran
told them that he wotted well their story, and asked them whether they were
indeed fain to see their child again.</p>

<p>"Ah! Prince," moaned the na&iuml;ve old Vulfrand, "If the dear God had but
one angel in all heaven&mdash;and he lost her&mdash;dost think he would not be fain
for her face again?" And Ludwige wailed an echo to that plaint. Then
the king spoke much with them both, and knew that, in sooth, these two
loved their daughter well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one after one, the priests and bishops were filling the chamber;
but Vulfrand and Ludwige, with eyes only for the king, knew nought of this,
until Gontran made a movement causing them to look round. Then, when
they saw themselves in the midst of this royal assembly, they feared greatly,
and Ludwige clung to her husband. But, with a smile and a gracious nod,
the king reassured them, and bade them be seated upon two stools, not far
from his own person. So they sat amazed, and knew not yet whether good
was to befall them, or evil.</p>

<p>Gontran made a sign, and a great silence fell upon all. Then there
entered a young page, bearing, upon a cushion of azure velvet, three small,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
golden crowns, the which he laid at the king's feet. Then that sainted and
holy bishop, Gregory of Tours, rose from his chair in the great hall, and
approached the throne. The page lifted, and put into his hands, the cushion
and the three crowns. Holding them forth, Gregory turned to that august
assembly.</p>

<p>"These three crowns," said he, "are each the reward of a merit&mdash;merits
widely differing, yet such as Heaven is pleased to unite, sometimes, in a
single being. Yestereve were you and I permitted to see and to hear her
whom God has so privileged; and you shall now judge whether she is worthy
of these rewards, or rather, whether these rewards are worthy of her."</p>

<p>"The first of these crowns is the crown of beauty&mdash;you have seen her,
lords. The second is the crown of virtue&mdash;and how great hers is, you know
well. The third is the crown of courage&mdash;you have heard her, and you have
acclaimed her, even as have I." A murmur of assent rolled through the
assembly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young maid had been brought into the hall. She was
dressed in fair, white raiment, and veiled, even to her feet. She drew near
to the throne; and her tread was light as the foot-fall of an angel. Ludwige
and Vulfrand could not take their eyes from off her. Their hearts beat
within them as never before; yet they scarce knew why; though, indeed,
they sat beside a king.</p>

<p>"Come hither, noble child," said Gregory of Tours. And he took the
golden crowns in his hands, and laid upon the royal dais the azure cushion,
and bade the maid kneel thereon. Then he gave the three golden crowns in
to the hands of the king, and yielding place to him, stood respectfully by his
side. The king spoke.</p>

<p>"Noble child, Heaven has granted you beauty, and beauty deserves a
crown. Here is the crown of beauty." And he laid upon her brow the
first golden circlet. Then he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Noble child, thine is the purest virtue; virtue deserves a crown. Here
is the crown of virtue." And he placed upon her head the second golden
circlet. A third time the king spoke.</p>

<p>"Noble child, you have given proof of strong courage; and courage
deserves a crown. Here is the crown of courage." And he laid upon her
head the third golden round. Vulfrand and Ludwige gazed breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Now, brave maiden," added the king, "raise your veil." The girl
obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"My daughter!... Bertille!" ... "My Mother!" The
two women wept in each other's arms. Vulfrand drew near to the king.</p>

<p>"There was that within, Sire, told me you knew somewhat of my
daughter." Gontran smiled.</p>

<p>"Good people," said he to the happy parents, "Bertille will go back with
you to Ch&acirc;lon, and there, if I know aught of maids' minds, she will tell
you all. Be happy, then; for God has given you a daughter after His Own
Heart." Then, turning to the assembly, he spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Lords, since the fatal passage of the Huns across our land, our walls
have lain in ruin. We must needs raise them again. In so doing, let us
preserve the memory of Bertille's triumph. Three bands of gilded stone
shall be built within the wall, to serve it for a girdle; and to remind all
descendants to whom our fair city may pass, of the honour due to beauty, to
courage, and to virtue."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Loud rang the applause from all the townspeople, when, that very
evening, Bertille and her parents returned to their home. The family of
dead Amalon were forbidden by Gontran, on pain of extinction, to molest
further either parents or daughter, and soon, around the new walls of the
royal city of Ch&acirc;lon, ran a triple girdle of gold&mdash;the three crowns we see
to-day upon the arms of the town.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The first thing we did on arriving at Ch&acirc;lon was to mount our bicycles
and cross the river to the Church of St. Marcel, all that now remains of the
ancient abbey. The feature of the journey was the number of rough
Bressane carts we met, filled with potatoes, and drawn, very deliberately, by
yoked, dreamy, creamy oxen, whose mild eyes were veiled by fringes of
string, tied across the forehead, to keep off the flies.</p>

<p>The Abbey church is a well-proportioned and satisfactory early
Burgundian building, with a high narthex, a western tower, and a late
Renaissance west front. It is designed rather in the Cistercian manner, with
a square apse and two apsidal chapels, square and semi-circular respectively.
The whole forms a fine example of early purity of style. Excepting the
simple foliage of the capitals and the bosses of the high vault, one looks in
vain for any carving, and there is very little moulding that catches the eye.
The orders of the arches are left square-edged, and the ridges of the aisle
vaulting scarcely show. The piers of the nave, too, are square, with circular
shafts to carry the vault.</p>

<p>Over the High Altar are two ch&acirc;sses with the relics of St. Agricola and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
St. Marcel. A notice in the church informs one that, in the year 879,
John VIII. canonized in this church the holy bishops of Ch&acirc;lon; also that,
on Holy Saturday, April 13th, 1805, Pope Pius VII. came to visit the relics
of Saint Marcel and Saint Agricola, and blessed the High Altar.</p>

<p>But the most interesting memory associated with the Abbey is that of the
first of the modernists, Ab&eacute;lard, whose name is linked for ever with that of
his lover, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se. Only the peaceful, closing years of Ab&eacute;lard's stormy
life connect him with Burgundy; but his stay at Cluny, under the care of
Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable, and his last days and burial at St. Marcel, justify me, I
hope, in telling again here the life stories of two whose names, with those of
Aucassin and Nicolette, Petrarch and Laura, Dante and Beatrice, Paolo and
Francesca, are blazoned, for all time, upon the scrolls of love.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1105, or 1106, that a young Breton, about sixteen years
of age, of good family, came to Paris to study at the schools of the Quartier
Latin, on the Montagne St. G&ecirc;nevi&egrave;ve, now occupied by the buildings of
the Sorbonne. His father, the Seigneur de Pallet, near Nantes, had destined
his son for the profession of arms; but a natural bent towards books and
learning, and the consequent ambition to become formidable in "logic,"
induced the lad to abandon prospects of fortune and military glory, to play
a prominent and extraordinarily romantic part in the religious and philosophical
movements of the greatest century of the middle ages.</p>

<p>The schools of philosophy of Paris were already the most famous in the
world, when Ab&eacute;lard put himself, as he expresses it in a letter to Philintus,
"under the direction of one Champeaux, a professor who had acquired the
character of the most skilful philosopher of his age, but by negative excellencies
only, as being the least ignorant." The boy was well received at
first, but his abilities in debate and dialectics soon aroused the natural
jealousy of a master, who perceived himself to be no match for his pupil.
Ab&eacute;lard withdrew to Melun for safety, and for the better establishment of
his fast-developing theories concerning the necessary compatibility of dogma
and reason, summed up in the phrase "Nul ne peut croire sans avoir
compris," an axiom fraught with danger in the middle ages, and in those
which succeeded them.</p>

<p>After some years of retirement, the young dialectician attended the schools
of Anselm, Bishop of Laon, where, finding himself thoroughly dissatisfied
with the teaching of one of whom he could only say, "Stet magni nominus
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
umbra," he decided to take for his guides the primitive fathers, and to launch
boldly, for himself, into the study of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>When he deemed the time ripe, he returned to Paris, where his success
drew many to him; so many that, before long, the fame of the young Breton,
now Maitre Pierre, author of the "Gloze d'Ez&eacute;chiel," the great teacher of
the new doctrine of Conceptualism, was finding an echo in all Paris. He
became the centre of a school of young enthusiasts, who hung upon his
words. These early years of success in Paris were, intellectually, the most
fruitful of his life, but they had a disastrous effect upon a character, the
strength of which was never equal to that of his mind. His pride and vanity,
naturally great, became consuming. Freedom of thought was not sufficient
for him; so great a liberationist must live a free life; the scholars must share
him with the courtesans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a little house in the western end of the Isle de la Cit&eacute;, at
the foot of Notre Dame, that already was beginning to lift its mighty bulk
above the palace of the king, and the surrounding churches and cloisters,
were living Canon Fulbert and his young niece, fifteen years old, who had
just completed her education at the convent of Argenteuil. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se was a
girl of unusual ability. That her talents are no mere legend, is abundantly
proved by her letters, that rank her among the great women of literature.
And she had yet more dangerous gifts&mdash;character, charm, beauty. This
white lily, blossoming among the cloisters, was the one flower that could
draw from Ab&eacute;lard the soul no courtesan had been able to reach. She was
fair, sweet, impressionable; looking out upon a lovely world, and waiting
only for love to lighten it. He was famous, young, tall, handsome, and
well-dressed, beyond the wont of scholars.<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> No more was needed. Their
destiny was upon them. They met; and looked long into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>Within a short time, Ab&eacute;lard was installed in the Canon's house; commissioned
to instruct H&eacute;lo&iuml;se in philosophy. "It is my wish that she should
obey you in everything," said the guileless uncle, in confiding his niece to
her tutor. "Employ every means, even manual chastisement, if you judge it
necessary, to stimulate her zeal and constrain her to further submission."<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Fulbert was to discover, only too soon, how little need there was for such an
injunction.</p>

<p>So the professor of thirty-eight and the maiden of seventeen sat side by
side over their book of philosophy, until, at length, their eyes rose from the
page to one another, "And that day they read no farther."<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Day by day
their mutual sympathy increased, though the, as yet, innocent liaison still masqueraded
in the guise of a platonic friendship, while, all the time, says
Ab&eacute;lard, "There came more words of love than philosophy into our conversations,
and more kisses than explanations."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ab&eacute;lard the lover was at war with Ab&eacute;lard the philosopher.
Gradually, to their astonishment and dismay, it dawned upon his students
in the Sainte Montagne, that the metaphysical speculations of their Master
had lost something of the accustomed brilliance; that the well of his eloquence
was drying up. Then came a greater shock. Maitre Pierre, their
own Maitre Pierre, was writing love songs, like any ballad-monger; and all
Paris was singing them.</p>

<p>They were very beautiful love songs, sincere love songs; for Ab&eacute;lard and
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se were in love. Few knew it, least of all Fulbert, who, dreaming the
days away in his stall in the choir of Notre Dame, appears to have had no
suspicions concerning the bona-fides of the philosopher in his house. But,
one day, coming home unexpectedly, he surprised the lovers in a close embrace.
His fury was intense. All his love for Ab&eacute;lard changing to hate,
he drove him from the house. He might well have done more than that,
had he known all; had he known that H&eacute;lo&iuml;se was to become a mother.</p>

<p>Ab&eacute;lard, in this crisis, appears to have acted with a certain degree of
courage. He entrusted his mistress to the care of his sister, Denise, at the
Bourg du Pallet, in Brittany, where she went in a nun's dress, to avert
suspicion as to her real condition. He endeavoured, too, to obtain the forgiveness
of her father; and even promised to marry his daughter, on condition
that the alliance was kept secret; but H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, with characteristic greatness of
mind, refused to compromise his career by so tightening his bonds. "The
title of mistress," she said, speaking with the extraordinary abandonment of
self that she always displayed toward her lover, "is infinitely sweeter to me
than that of wife." She allowed herself to be persuaded, however, and, after
the birth of her child, a son, she returned to Paris, where the secret marriage
was celebrated, and Ab&eacute;lard returned to his scholastic duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>But the
presence of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se irked him; probably he felt it impossible to play the
double part of husband and philosopher, while his wife was within reach;
and he succeeded in persuading her, docile as ever, to return to the cloisters
of Argenteuil. So far, he had suffered the least of the three involved in this
tragedy; but Nemesis was close at hand. Fulbert, outwardly satisfied, was
contemplating a dire revenge.</p>

<p>All Paris was startled, one morning, by the rumour of an extraordinary
crime. A ruffian, armed with a razor, had broken into Maitre Pierre's house,
at night, and had shamefully mutilated the teacher. It was true. Ab&eacute;lard
was unsexed; and Fulbert, fully avenged, had fled from Paris. Loud was
the lamentation in the Sainte Montagne.</p>

<p>The dominant feeling aroused by such a humiliation, in the mind of a
man so proud as Ab&eacute;lard, was, naturally, that of shame; penitence took but a
second place. He felt that he could face the world no longer; yet jealousy
told him that he could not take the cowl, while another took H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, and
knew delights, spiritual and carnal, that had once been his. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, living
only in and for her earthly husband, could refuse him nothing at such a
crisis. She took the veil at Argenteuil, and became, for her lover's sake, the
spouse of Christ. Ab&eacute;lard donned the robe of the Benedictines at the great
abbey of St. Denis, in 1119.</p>

<p>If he had expected to regain peace and serenity in such a house, he must
have been grievously disappointed. The abbey of St. Denis had not escaped
the degeneracy that had already overtaken many of the monastic institutions
of the day. It had become a centre of private and political intrigue, a
pleasure resort for the fashionable life of Paris; laughter and the rustle of
ladies' robes were heard in the long alleys of the cloister.<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Against these
abuses the new-comer was not slow to raise his eloquent voice. It was not
heeded, or was received only with jeers. Ab&eacute;lard withdrew, by permission,
to the monastery of Deuil, close by, where he opened a school, and gave
himself up again to teaching, and to propagating the advanced theology that
had already scandalized the more orthodox of Paris. His treatise on "The
Divine Trinity and Unity," brought him before the Council of Soissons.
The persecution of the freethinker had begun; and though the daring innovator
endeavoured strenuously to justify his writings, the fathers condemned
him to throw, with his own hands, his book into the lighted brazier prepared
in the midst of the assembly. He was then handed over, for correction, to
the care of the abbot of St. M&eacute;dard de Soissons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>This sentence was soon annulled, and Ab&eacute;lard found himself once more
at St. Denis. But not for long. Sleeping enmities were aroused; and, one
night, Ab&eacute;lard, with the connivance of certain monks, fled secretly from the
abbey, and took refuge near Nogent, in a remote part of Champagne, where
he hoped "to avoid fame" and live secure against the malice of his enemies.
But to avoid fame was not in the reformer's destiny. The hermit was soon
surrounded by his followers, who converted a natural grotto into a chapel, and
built themselves rustic huts of boughs and thatch, in this Paraclet,<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the place
of their master's consolation.</p>

<p>Again he re-opened his school, again many listened to his defence of the
truth, again he aroused the enmity of the orthodox church, who, this time,
had as their champion the greatest name in all Christendom, the more than
Pope, St. Bernard. Ab&eacute;lard's four happy years of quiet service were at an
end. He fled to the lonely abbey of St. Gildas, in Brittany, his native
province, "a barbarous country, the language of which I do not understand,"
where his walks were along the inaccessible shore of a sea that was always
stormy, where dissolute monks lived only to hunt, "and the doors and walls
were without ornament, save the heads of wild boars and the feet of hinds
and the hides of frightful animals."<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p class="pmb1">During all these years, though neither was forgotten by the other, no
communication had passed between Ab&eacute;lard the monk and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se the nun.
Now, for a brief period, the currents of their lives were to mingle again. In
the year 1128, the monastery of Argenteuil passed to the abbey of St. Denis,
then ruled by Suger, who was no friend to Ab&eacute;lard. The nuns were dispersed,
and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se and her sisters found themselves without shelter. Here
was the old lover's opportunity. Paraclet, bereft of its lord, had no tenants;
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se had no home. An impulse swiftly acted upon, some sudden instinct
of pity, of desire, of remorse for the sufferings of which he was the
responsible cause, led Ab&eacute;lard to obtain permission to offer her the shelter of
his old retreat. She accepted this offer, and established there a nunnery, of
which she herself was appointed to be the first abbess. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se and her
sisters were to follow the rigorous rule of St. Benedict, modified by
Ab&eacute;lard&mdash;after special study&mdash;as a concession to the frail physique of women.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The old lovers, both taught in the stern school of suffering, seem to have
accepted, with full self-control, the new and spiritual relationship upon which
they were about to enter. In the priest's case, that is more easily understood.
For him, though still he says, "I sigh, I weep, I grieve, I speak the
dear name of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, I delight to hear the sound," the days of physical
desire were past for ever.</p>

<p>But what an effort must it have cost the woman, not yet in her thirtieth
year, and with her beauty still in bloom, to accept her position, to respect
his; to honour as her spiritual brother only, him who was her lover and her
husband. Yet she did it&mdash;though with awful searchings of heart, with
longings, and inward rebellion against fate, that her letters have, in measure,
revealed. Happily for her, the torturing joy of their last meetings was not
for long. Already rumours and scandal were busy with their names.
Ab&eacute;lard came one day to Paraclet; then he came no more. The lovers were
not to meet again in this world. Only letters would pass between them&mdash;letters
that reveal in a wonderful light the passive strength of her character,
the utter surrender of herself, body, soul, and spirit, to the man who had
won her love. As literature, they reveal the fact that H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, had she
given her life to such work, could have excelled all the men of her time<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
in the domain of letters. As human documents, their correspondence
remains</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A dream, an idyll, call it what you will,</span>
<span class="i0">Of man still man, and woman&mdash;woman still."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The man remained the man, in that, true to his new relationship to her,
with the passing of the years he became less the lover and more the priest;
he conquered, or he cooled. The woman, true to her type, renounced; but
she, though she, too, attained a measure of spiritual liberty, never repented,
and I think that she never really changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The last episodes in the stormy life of Ab&eacute;lard are soon told. On his
final return from Paraclet, he found the monks risen in active revolt against
him. Attempts were made, even, to poison him in the holy cup; and he
hardly escaped the assassin's knife. In this extremity his thoughts turned
again to the scene of those early successes in the Montagne St. G&ecirc;nevi&egrave;ve,
and Paris saw and heard him for the last time. Years that had bowed his
head, had not changed the bent of his mind. The innovator was the
innovator still. To Bernard, busily engaged in reforming his order in the
lonely Vall&eacute;e d'Absinthe, came the news that Ab&eacute;lard, whom he thought a
spent force, had broken out once more. The fanatic was furious. "On
fermera cette bouche avec des b&acirc;tons," he said, and girded up his loins "to
fight the dragon." From his renewed triumphs among the scholars of the
Latin quarter, Ab&eacute;lard was summoned to the last great public scene of his
life, the Council of Sens.</p>

<p>It was on January 11th, 1140. The King of France, young Louis VII.,
presided over the assembly. Ab&eacute;lard had hoped to be heard in his own
defence; but judgment had already been decided upon. The offensive
volume had been read, and condemned, overnight, by the prelates, sleeping
over their cups. Upon the occurrence of an objectionable passage, the
reader had interrogated the somewhat somnolent judges. "<i>Damnates?</i>"
to which one drowsy voice had answered, "Damnamus"; while the remainder,
aroused by the noise, responded, in half articulate, but appropriate
chorus, "Namus."<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Ab&eacute;lard, the ascetic, was condemned by the satellites
of Bacchus.</p>

<p>The old man, broken, yet still resolute, determined to appeal to the Pope.
He set out on the long journey for Rome; but got no further than Cluny,
where Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable received him, with all the gentle and tolerant
affection that reveal him as one of the most lovable characters of the century.
He obtained the Pope's permission to let Ab&eacute;lard remain with him; he even
succeeded in reconciling him with the hitherto implacable St. Bernard. The
old orator passed the last two years of his life in the quietude of Cluny,
growing ever weaker in body, ever calmer in soul. At last Pierre le V&eacute;n&eacute;rable
had him removed to the Abbey of St. Marcel de Ch&acirc;lon, hoping that
the change might restore his health; but the end had come. On April 11th,
1142, the Reformer died.<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierre, writing to H&eacute;lo&iuml;se of her husband, says: "It is not easy to tell in a
few lines, O my sister, the saintliness, the humility, the abnegation that he
showed us, to which the whole monastery can bear witness.... I gave
him high rank among our brothers, but he would be as the least of all by the
simplicity of his clothing. It was the same with his food and all that touched
upon the delights of the senses ... he refused everything but what was
indispensable to life. He read continually, he prayed often, he kept perpetual
silence."</p>

<p>H&eacute;lo&iuml;se received her lover's body, and buried it in her own convent of
Paraclet. She survived Ab&eacute;lard twenty years, ruling her convent so well
that it became one of the most famous religious houses in France, in high
repute with all the great ecclesiastics of the day. Legend, always busy with
such lives and loves as theirs, tells us, in an ancient chronicle of Tours, that
when they laid the body of the Abbess in the tomb of her Ab&eacute;lard, who had
rested there already twenty years, the faithful husband raised his arms,
stretched them forth, and closely embraced his H&eacute;lo&iuml;se.<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We turn now to a later phase of Burgundian life&mdash;the tournaments that
are remembered in connection with such towns as Chalon-Sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, and
Dijon.</p>

<p>Olivier de la Marche, that loyal servant of the House of Valois, for whom
he suffered so many mischances, has given us, in his memoirs, a good account
of the great tournament of La Dame des Pleurs, which took place at Ch&acirc;lon,
in a field on the far side of the river, in 1449.</p>

<p>Two famous knights of the time, the Sire of Lalain, who had sworn to
appear thirty times in the lists before he attained his thirtieth year, and the
Seigneur Pierre de Vasco, had caused a great pavilion to be set up, and lists
to be made ready, where, for a whole year, they engaged themselves to fight
against all coming in the name of La Dame des Pleurs. "Now this pavilion
was palissaded and barred right honourably, and none might approach it without
leave of Charolois the herald, a right honourable herald, officer-at-arms
of the Count Charles of Charolois; and he wore his coat-of-arms, and bore
a white baton in his hand, and kept the images ordered for the challenger's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
enterprise: and first at the head of that pavilion, as high as might be, was
set, on a picture, a representation of the glorious Virgin Mary, holding the
Redeemer of the World, her Lord and her Son; and below, on the right side
of the picture was fashioned a lady right honestly and richly clad, and her
master in simple attire; and she was in guise of weeping so sore, that the
tears were falling even on to the left side, where was shown a fountain, and
on it a unicorn seated, seeming to embrace the three targets, arranged for the
three manners of arms the challenger might furnish for his enterprise; of
which the first was white, for the arms of the axe, the second violet for the
arms of the sword, and the third (which was below in the manner of a
triolet) was black for the arms of the lance, and the said targets were all sown
with blue tears; and for these causes was the lady named the Lady of Tears,
and the fountain, the Fountain of Tears. Now have I shown the enterprise
and the ordering of this noble meeting (<i>pas</i>): which things were strange and
new in the country, and much admired and seen of many and divers
personages.</p>

<p>"That same day came to the palace a herald, named Toulongeon, who
summoned the herald guard of the pavilion and said to him: 'Noble herald,
I ask that you open to me, that I may go and touch one of the targets that
are in your guard, for, and in the name of a noble squire named Pierre de
Chandios.' The herald received him right joyously, and told him that he
was very welcome; and opened to him; and the said Toulongeon, like an
officer well learned, kneeled before the Virgin Mary, saluted honourably the
Lady of Tears, and then touched the white target, and said, 'I touch the
white target for and in the name of Pierre de Chandios esquire: and affirm
in word of truth, saying that on the day which shall be appointed him, he
will furnish in his person the conditioned and ordered arms for the said
target, according to the contents of the chapters of the noble challenger, if
God keep him from encumbrance and loyal cares.' And so he left, and the
palissades were shut again, and the pavilion remained spread and guarded
until mid-day, when Charolois told of the enterprise and made his report to
the good knight messire Jacques de Lalain of his day's adventure, and how
Pierre de Chandios had caused the white target to be touched: at which he
rejoiced greatly, and welcomed Toulongeon the herald of these good news,
gave gift, and named him an early day for the fight, which was the following
Saturday.</p>

<p>"On that day (which was the thirteenth day of September) the lists were
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
made ready, and the house of the judge and the pavilions were spread for the
champions; and that of messire Jacques was of white satin, sown with blue
tears; and that of Chandios of rose red silk emblazoned with his arms about
the roof: and came the judge to his place, accompanied by Guillaume, lord
of Sarcy, then bailiff of Ch&acirc;lon, by master Pierre, lord of Goux, a great man
in the grand council of the duke, and who was afterwards chancellor; and
of several other councillors and noblemen well versed in the noble profession
of arms. These having taken their places, the said messire Jacques quitted
the church of Les Carmes, situate at the gate of the town and of the faubourg
of the gate of St. Jehan-du-Maiseau; and after having heard three masses
very devoutly, entered into a covered boat, accompanied by messire Pierre de
Vasco and by several other noblemen of his house (for he kept very great
state), and he found also, of many in the country two noblemen, brothers
german; of whom the elder was messire Claude de Toulongeon, lord of La
Bastie, and the other Tristan de Toulongeon, lord of Soucy ... and
because the said messire Jacques was a stranger in the country, they accompanied
him: nor evermore during this contest did they leave him.</p>

<p>"Thus the knight crossed the river of Sa&ocirc;ne, and came to land at the
island on which he was to fight: and there jumped out of his boat, clothed
in a long robe of cloth of gold, furred with sable. He held his banner in
his hand, figured with his devotions; with which he signed himself at the
same time, and right well it became him. So came he into the lists, and
presented himself before the judge,<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and spake with his own mouth these
words: "Noble king-of-arms of the Golden Fleece, commissioned by my most
redoubted and sovereign lord the duke of Burgundy and count of Hainault,
to be my judge in this trial, I present myself before you to keep and defend
this enterprise and contest and on my part to furnish and accomplish the
arms chosen and required by Pierre de Chandios according to the contents of
the chapters on that behalf." The judge, habited in the coat-of-arms of the
Duke of Burgundy, the white baton in his hand, received and welcomed him
right honourably, and the challenger withdrew into his pavilion.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not long had he been there, when there appeared upon the great bridge
of Ch&acirc;lon the said Pierre de Chandios, who was coming upon his horse,
armed with all arms, the bacinet upon his head and the coat-of-arms upon
his back; and, in truth, he was one of the greatest and most powerful
squires in all Burgundy, or in Nivernais, and might, in age, be thirty-one
years or thereabouts. He was accompanied by the lords of Mirebeau,
of Charny and of Seyl, and by so many lords and nobles of Burgundy that I
should estimate the company at more than four hundred noblemen. The
said de Chandios entered the lists upon a horse emblazoned with his arms,
and dismounted; and the lord of Charny led him on his right before the
judge, and made speech, and said: 'Noble King of Arms of the Golden
Fleece, commissioned by my most redoubted and sovereign lord the duke and
count of Burgundy, judge in this cause, here is Pierre de Chandios, my
nephew, who presents himself before you, in order that, God aiding him,
he may furnish and accomplish the arms by him undertaken and required, in
encounter with the challenger of this noble contest, according to the condition
of the chapters, and of the white target which he has caused to be
touched.'</p>

<p>"The King of Arms welcomed him and received him as was his due, and
withdrew into his pavilion: and this done, everyone withdrew from the lists,
and the accustomed cries were begun; and meanwhile a cousin german of
mine, named Anthony de la Marche, lord of Sandon, appointed marshall of
the lists, drew near to the said Chandios by the judge's command, and bid
him declare the number of strokes of the axe he required, and demanded to
make and furnish these arms: and the said Chandios declared seventeen
strokes of the axe. So the said marshall came to the judge to acquaint him
of the number of strokes, and then he came to the said Jacques de Lalain, to
acquaint him of his adversary's intention, and also to ask of him the axes
which he must deliver to furnish and do battle withal. So were two axes
given and delivered to him, which were long and heavy; and the mallets and
heads of the said axes were fashioned like falcons' beaks, with large and
heavy spikes above and beneath: and were bladed with a screw-plate of flat
iron, with three nail-heads short and thick, diamond fashion, and somewhat
after the manner of lance blades for jousting with arms of war, without
roquet; and the said axes were taken to the said de Chandios to chose from:
and a moment after Pierre de Chandios sallied forth from his pavilion,
clothed in his coat-of-arms, his bacinet on his head and his visor lowered,
crossing himself with his bannerolle: and then did his uncle, the lord of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Charny, deliver him his axe and accompanied him far into the lists. On the
other side came forth messire Jacques de Lalain: and had his harness
covered, in place of a coat-of-arms, with an over-mantle with sleeves of
white satin sown with blue tears, of the same colour as the target that his
adversary had touched. He wore a little round helmet, and had his visor
covered, and protected with a little collar-piece of steel-mail (maille d'acier):
and after the recommendation of his bannerolle, Messire Pierre Vasco handed
him his axe.</p>

<p>"So paced the champions each towards the other with great assurance, and
met before the judge, and, at first each was on his guard against the other.
But before long they ran together and dealt great and heavy blows, knightly
given and borne on one side and the other; and I remember that the said de
Lalain (who knew that the axes he had given and delivered had no spike nor
point with which he could bend nor injure his adversary) stepping aside some
distance turned his axe, making the head the tail, and the tail the head: and
came forward again with a great effort and reached the said Chandios, with
the spike of his axe on the vizor of the bacinet, and gave him so great a blow
that he broke the point on the vizor; but the said Chandios (who was strong
and great, powerful and valiant) did not give way; but began again the
battle between them more fiercely and proudly than before, so that they beset
one another so fiercely that in a short time the seventeen strokes required
by the said de Chandios were accomplished.</p>

<p>"Then Toison d'Or threw down the baton, and the combattants were
taken and separated by the men-at-arms appointed as guard and attendants,
and to act as is the wont in such a case; and they, taken before the judge,
touched together, and returned each whence he had come, and those arms
were accomplished (achev&eacute;es) on a Saturday, the 18th day of September, the
year 49."<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>So ended the first combat, which was followed by many others at which
several knights and squires of Burgundy, Nivernais, Savoy and Switzerland
presented themselves. Among the audience were the duke and duchess of
Orleans and a brilliant company from the court of Italy. At the close of
the tournament a great banquet was given to all the nobles who had taken
part, at which the guests were entertained with many "entremets," as the
representations given during the repast were called.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The giver of the feast
had desired that all combattants should be painted in their armour, and his
own portrait was exhibited with a couplet at the foot, expressing thanks to
all noble companions who had accepted him as adversary, and offering to
serve them on all occasions, in person or property, as their brother in arms.
He presented to Toison d'Or a fair robe of sable, and after having courteously
saluted the Lady of Tears, and kissed the feet of the Holy Virgin, he
retired; and the picture, the image and the unicorn were carried, in solemn
procession, to the church of Ch&acirc;lon.<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>We shall hear more of these Burgundian Tournaments when we come
to speak of the royal court at Dijon, and the festivities of the Tree of Charlemagne.
Here I conclude the subject, for the present, merely reminding my
readers that these heavily armoured and comparatively innocuous fights were
but the slow development of sterner combats, such as that which occurred
in 1273, when Edward I. of England passed through Burgundy, on his way
to meet Philip III. returning from Italy. The Burgundians, wishing fittingly
to celebrate the occasion, organized a tourney at Chalon-Sur-Sa&ocirc;ne.
"There was a battle," says Mathew of Westminster, "but the English were
victors and slew several who were despoiling the conquered; but as these
last were men of small condition, the matter was not followed up."<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Modern Chalon-Sur-Sa&ocirc;ne has not very much that is attractive. The
most interesting streets are those around the old cathedral of St. Vincent,
before which, on Sunday morning, there is a busy market scene. The
church is a fairly good specimen of Burgundian Gothic of the 12th to 14th
centuries; but it appears to have been so much restored that a dogmatic
opinion concerning its age would be unusually dangerous. The choir appears
to be of the 13th century, and the arches, with unribbed vaults, of the late
12th. Strong Roman and Byzantine influence is everywhere apparent, and
there are some rich late Gothic side chapels. The upper part of the design
betrays the same fault as at St. B&eacute;nigne de Dijon. The triforium&mdash;weakly
designed&mdash;and the parapet above it, are lifted up to the clerestory, leaving an
unsightly space of bare wall above the arches of the nave. The shafts of the
high vault are taken down, as usual, on to fluted pilasters, with highly ornamented
capitals. The fa&ccedil;ade of the church is modern, and unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="pmb1">In the old quarter, I remember one particularly good timbered Gothic
house, known as the Maison de Bois.</p>

</div>
<p class="pmb2" />


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Tournus is an attractive old town, lying asleep on a hill beside the Sa&ocirc;ne.
Through it ran, north and south, the old Roman road of Agrippa. Its chief
monument, the church of the ancient abbey of St. Philibert, whether viewed
from within or from without, is one of the most striking examples I know,
of the barbaric majesty of early Burgundian art. The grim fa&ccedil;ade, with its
two-storied narthex of three bays&mdash;the oldest Clunisian porch&mdash;and its
machicolations and towers, recalls the fortified churches of Provence and
Languedoc, built when the southern land still shook with fear at the thought
of the northern "crusaders," or the sea-pirates of the south. Nor does the
sight of the interior do other than confirm that impression.</p>

<p>Passing through the lower storey of the gloomy portal, that might well
have served to imprison the bodies of men&mdash;just as, symbolically, it was a
shadowy ante-chamber, a purgatory of souls not yet fitted for the full light
of Paradise&mdash;we emerged into a church whose rugged strength had in it something
awful and menacing, suggestive of a period even more barbaric than
that eleventh century in which the nave and narthex were built.</p>

<p>This impression may possibly have a historical as well as an imaginative
basis, owing to the fact that the church has been twice destroyed&mdash;first by the
Huns, and later by fire&mdash;both disasters occurring so soon after construction,
that the original design may have been adhered to closely.<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Several points of detail catch the eye immediately, especially one most
unusual feature&mdash;that the axes of the barrelling are at right angles to the
longitudinal axes of the church. One notices also the great height of the
aisles, and the transfer of capitals from their usual position on the columns
of the nave, to the vaulting shafts. The aisle columns are engaged in the
wall. The apse has a fine ambulatory, and five square radiating chapels.
This part of the church dates from the latter part of the eleventh century,
and contrary to the evidence of the square chapels, which are somewhat
Cistercian, was built under Clunisian influence. Roman example also is
apparent. Over the transept is a fine central tower of the twelfth century,
beneath which is a dome with Burgundian fluted pilasters. The general
barbarity of the romanesque is lightened in the apse by carved shafts, of great
delicacy and beauty, which have been selected by Viollet-le-Duc for illustrating
the section on colonnettes in his "Dictionnaire Raisonn&eacute;."</p>

<p>The lower part of the narthex, or rather its extraordinarily massive pillars,
are generally attributed to the tenth century; the towers, both of which have
some good carving, to the eleventh; and the upper part of the south-west
tower to the twelfth. The upper chamber of the narthex, loopholed in
several places, was probably intended for the defence of the abbey,<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> further
security being afforded by the enceinte and gate, of which the round tower
opposite formed part. A door opened from the upper narthex to the interior
of the church, so that defenders might attend the office.</p>

<p>The crypt, which occupies the whole of the space beneath the choir, has
many pillars, so cunningly disposed that they give to this part of the church
an appearance of much greater size than is really the case. It contains
several relics of the past, notably a wooden vierge of the twelfth century, the
sarcophagus of St. Val&eacute;rien, and a twelfth century fresco, the earliest of its
kind in the department. The central chapel in the crypt is the best part of
the building, architecturally; though the beautiful columns and capitals of
the eleventh century, including two Roman ones, do not harmonize well with
the primitive roof.</p>

<p>Very little now remains of the ancient monastery; but the fifteenth-century
salle abbatiale is still to be seen in the Place des Arts, on the south-east
side of the church. The buildings on the site of the cloisters are still
known as the carr&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Saint Philibert, after whom the church is named, was not a Burgundian
saint; but the monks who had the keeping of his relics, driven from their
monastery of Noirmoutiers, established themselves at Tournus. That the
cult of this Saint eventually gained great popularity in Burgundy, is evident
from the number of churches&mdash;St. Philibert of Dijon, of Mersault, &amp;c.&mdash;dedicated
to him throughout the province.</p>

<p>While I was in St. Philibert, my wife was sketching and writing in the
sunny street outside. I have purloined the following from her notebook.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_162.jpg" width="620" height="433" alt="A Street in Tournus" title="" />
</div>

<p>"When I think of Tournus, there comes to my mind the picture of a dear
little street bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. On my left, as I sit, pencil
in hand, is the west front of the Cathedral, and in front of me, a row of little,
low, whitewashed cottages line the street. Above the last cottage there rises
a heavy gable, thick, and white, and solid, pierced only by one little grated
window. This gable is a fragment of the old abbey, and the arched grating
is the window of the refectory used by the monks. There are small shops
and more cottages on my right. The street slopes downhill, and ends in a
little, round, white tower, with a round, brown, pointed hat. It is the sort
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of tower that one longs to get round the other side of, or, best of all, into.
A great, warm, purple shadow crosses the street in front of me, and creeps
a little way up the white cottages opposite. It leaves a piece of wall in
brilliant, dazzling sun, and then begins again in a jagged, purple lace fringe,
under the heavy frieze of vine-leaves over the doors.</p>

<p>"An old lady, in white cap and woolly shawl, walks out of a cottage, and
into my sketch. The little boys round me, with best striped Sunday socks,
and mouths full of sweets, suddenly become eager and interested, whereas
before they were only curious.</p>

<p>"Hey! La gran'm&egrave;re!" they whisper excitedly; and a discussion ensues
as to whose grandmother it is. There must be heaps of grandmothers in
Tournus, and I have only shown her back view disappearing round the little
white tower. And, because of the human interest with which my picture is
now endowed, the crowd of little boys becomes quite twice as large."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wandering to-day through the quiet, sleepy, but by no means poverty-stricken
streets of Tournus, one can easily forget the condition of awful misery
to which this part of Burgundy was reduced at the close of the tenth and the
beginning of the eleventh centuries, when the old church of St. Philibert was
in course of construction. The horrors of that period&mdash;when the faithful,
eagerly awaiting the second coming of Christ, had, as they thought, ocular
demonstration that the end of all mankind was at hand&mdash;have been best depicted
for us by that strange figure, the priest, Raoul Glaber.</p>

<p>This, the most vivid historian of his time, was a wild, unbalanced, eccentric
visionary, whom one of his uncles, himself a monk, had dedicated to the same
vocation, in the hope that monkish discipline would cure his natural perversities.
The hope was not fulfilled, for Raoul the Bald, always restless and
dissatisfied, wandered, in turn, from monastery to monastery, appearing
successively at St. B&eacute;nigne de Dijon, Moutier St. Jean, St. Germain d'Auxerre,
B&eacute;ze, and Cluny, finding only in St. Guillaume and St. Odilon,
at the first and last named houses, masters of calibre enough to calm his
troubled spirit, and encourage his literary bent.</p>

<p>But, wherever he might be dwelling, Raoul remained an unhappy man,
a victim of a disordered and powerful imagination. He himself tells us of the
frequent visions to which he was subject; visions not without interest
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
as throwing light upon the mental condition of the time. At Moutier
appeared to him Guillaume de St. B&eacute;nigne, who, laying his hand upon the
bald head, said gently; "Do not forget me, I beg of you, if it be true that
I have sincerely loved you; accomplish rather, such is my desire, the work
you have promised to me."<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Not all his visions were so consoling. Conscience often brought the devil
to his dreams. He saw one night, standing at the foot of his bed, "A
hideous little monster. He was of middle height, with a thin neck, a skinny
figure, eyes very black, a narrow and wrinkled forehead, a flat nose, a wide
mouth, swollen lips, chin short and tapering, a goat's beard, straight ears, hair
dirty and stiff, dog's teeth, the back of his head pointed, a protruding belly,
a hump on the back, hanging buttocks and dirty clothing. His whole body
appeared to be animated by a convulsive and desperate activity. He seated
himself on the edge of my bed and proceeded to say to me; 'You will not
remain here much longer,' then ground his teeth and repeated; 'You shall
not stay here any longer.' I jumped out of bed; I ran to prostrate myself
at the foot of the altar of Father Benedict; I recapitulated all the sins I had
committed since my childhood, whether by negligence or perversity."</p>

<p>This strange work of his, which recounts in a chaotic, tortured manner,
without order and without literary grace, though with extraordinary vividness
and effect, the chief social, political, and religious events of the period dating
from 900 to 1046, is the most highly coloured, yet, at the same time, the most
sincere and the most valuable document we possess concerning the first half
of the eleventh century in Burgundy. The book deals only briefly with the
political events of his time, but is extraordinarily prolix concerning monks
and marvels, which are a source of constant bewilderment to his troubled
brain.</p>

<p>For poor Raoul never attained the calm assurance of the established Christianity
of his day, nor came near to realizing the monkish ideals of Cluny and
Citeaux. His book is full of dreadful visions, such as the one we have already
described. He sees the powers of evil lurking and prowling after men,
as lions that lie in wait for their prey. No Christian charity is found in him,
no tenderness, no hope; only the spirit of revolt, of discontent, of disgust;
superstitious fear and hallucinations chasing one another through his tortured
mind, until, at last, with despairing appeals to the Divine pity, he falls into
nervous crises which paralyse his mental and physical action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was so
terrible a state of mind then unnatural to any timid ones, whose temperament
forbade them to shelter soul, as well as body, within the safe fold of the
church. The events which Raoul himself describes as happening, within
his own experience, here, in this district round Tournus, are such as might
well wreck all but the strongest minds, or those fortified by an incorruptible
faith in the good providence of God. Look at his picture of the famine of
1031, and you will cease to wonder that, in those days, men dreamed strange
dreams.</p>

<p>"Famine commenced to desolate the universe, and the human race was
threatened with imminent destruction. The temperature (seasons) became
so contrary that no fitting time was found to sow the land, none favourable
to the harvest, chiefly on account of the water with which the fields were
flooded. One would have said that the elements, enraged, had declared war
on one another, when, they were, in fact, but obeying Divine vengeance in
punishing the insolence of men.... This avenging scourge had first
begun in the East; after having ravaged Greece, it passed to Italy, spread
among the Gauls and spared not even the people of England. All men
equally felt its attacks. The great, those of middle estate and the poor, all
had their mouths equally famished, the same pallor was upon their foreheads;
for even the violence of the great had given way at last to the common
dearth. When they had fed on beasts and birds, that resource once exhausted,
hunger was no less keenly felt, and, to appease it, men must needs resort to
devouring corpses, or even, to escape death, uproot the trees in the woods,
pluck the grass in the streams; but all was useless, for against the wrath of
God there is no refuge save God Himself. Alas! must we believe it?
Fury of hunger renewed those examples of atrocity so rare in history, and
men devoured the flesh of men. The traveller, assaulted on the road, succumbed
to the blows of his aggressors. His limbs were torn, grilled on the
fire, and devoured. Others, flying their country to escape famine, received
hospitality on the road, and their hosts slew them in the night that they might
furnish food. Others lured children away with the offer of an egg or an
apple, and immolated them to their hunger. In many a place corpses were
unearthed to serve for these sad repasts. One wretch dared even to carry
human flesh to the market of Tournus, to sell it cooked for that of animals.
He was arrested and did not attempt to deny his crime; he was garrotted,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
then thrown to the flames. Another, during the night, stole this flesh that
they had buried in the earth; he ate it, and was also burned.</p>

<p>"Three miles from M&acirc;con, in the forest of Ch&acirc;tigny, is an isolated church
consecrated to St. John. Not far from there, a scoundrel built a cabin,
where he cut the throats of any passers-by, or travellers who stopped with him.
The monster then fed upon their bodies. One day, a man came there with
his wife, to ask for hospitality, and rested a few moments. But, throwing
his glance round all the corners of the cabin he saw the heads of men, women
and children. Immediately he is troubled, he grows pale, he would leave;
but his cruel host endeavours to keep him there by force. The fear of death
doubles the traveller's strength; at last he escapes with his wife, and runs
with all haste to the town. There he hastens to communicate this frightful
discovery to Count Otho and all the other inhabitants. They send instantly
a large number of men to verify the fact; they press forward, and on their
arrival find the wild beast in his haunt, with forty-eight heads of men whom
he had butchered, and whose flesh he had already devoured. They take him
to the town, hang him up to a beam in a cellar, then throw him to the
flames. We, ourselves, were present at his execution."</p>

<p>"They tried, in the same province, a means which was not, we believe,
adopted elsewhere. Many persons mixed a white earth, like clay, with any
bran or flour they might have, and made loaves therewith to satisfy their cruel
hunger. The faces of all were pale and emaciated, the skin drawn tight and
swollen, the voice shrill and resembling the plaintive cry of dying birds. The
great number of the dead forbade any thought of their burial, and the wolves,
attracted for a long time past by the odour of corpses, came to tear their prey.
As they could not give separate burial to all the dead, because of their great
number, men full of the Grace of God, dug, in many places, ditches,
commonly called "Charniers," into which they would throw five hundred
bodies, and sometimes more when they would hold more; they lay there
mixed pell mell, half naked, often without any clothing. The cross-ways,
the ditches in the fields, served as burial places.</p>

<p>"The church ornaments were sacrificed to the needs of the poor. They
consecrated to the same purpose the treasures that had long been destined for
this use, as we find it written in the decree of the Fathers; but, in many
places, the treasures of the churches could not suffice for the necessities of the
poor. Often, even, when these wretches, long consumed by hunger, found
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
means to satisfy it, they swelled immediately and died; others held in their
hands, the food which they wished to raise to their lips; but this last effort
cost them their life, and they perished without having been able to enjoy
this sad pleasure. There are no words capable of expressing the pain, the
sadness, the sobs, the plaints, the tears of the unhappy witnesses of these
scenes of disaster, especially among the Churchmen, the bishops, the abbots,
the monks and the religieux. It was thought that the orders of the seasons
and the laws of the elements, which, till then, had governed the world, were
fallen back into eternal chaos, and all feared that the end of the human race
had come."</p>

<p>Let those who haste to decry modern institutions remember that to-day
you can buy bread in Tournus for a few sous the kilo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the great abbey church that still symbolizes, in its aspect, something
of the horror of those famine-stricken years in which it was built, we
wandered down the main street towards the river, and there rested at a little
caf&eacute; in the Place de l'H&ocirc;tel de Ville, which is adorned, as might have been
expected, by a statue of Greuze. Here we were waited on by a kindly, grey-haired,
stupid, but intensely curious old lady, who, wearied by sixty years of
monotonous Tournusian life, was anxious to imbibe from passing travellers,
all available gossip, concerning themselves and the world from which she was
cut off. My wife showed her some sketches. They left her cold.</p>

<p>"Vous faites &ccedil;a &agrave; coup d'oeil?" she said, and yawned.</p>

<p>"Madame est artiste," I interjected, carelessly, using a word which suggests
public performer, or actress, rather than artist. The old woman thawed.
Smiling, she turned to my wife.</p>

<p>"In that case madame will be able to earn her evening at the Caf&eacute; de la
Terrasse, beside the river. All the artistes go there, and there is a piano and
singing." We acquiesced, without intending to go. Meanwhile the old lady
studied my wife closely.</p>

<p>"Do you English people dress as we do; and are you married in church?"
She looked from one to another.</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> were," I said, "But everyone isn't." I had answered the last question
first. "And as to clothes, every painter and artistic person, as is well-known,
has her little 'mode &agrave; elle.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Justement," said our hostess, "Is this your tour de noces?"</p>

<p>The negative reply grieved her. While I paid for the coffee, Madame
cast an eye upon the retreating figure of my wife;</p>

<p>"Comme Madame est grande," she said, "Et bien belle!"</p>

<p>A few yards away, in the Rue de l'H&ocirc;pital, we came to a little inn with
the pretty sign "Au Point de Jour," and the inscription on a board, in capital
letters:</p>

<div class="block3">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Avan le jour commence ta journ&eacute;e</span>
<span class="i0">De l'Eternel le sainct nom b&eacute;nissant</span>
<span class="i0">Loue le encore et passe ainsy lann&eacute;e</span>
<span class="i0">Ayme Dieu et ton procchain. 1672."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A little girl, who had been sitting before the inn, approached. Pointing
to the inscription, she said scornfully:</p>

<p>"That's not French."</p>

<p>"Pardon, mon enfant," I said, "But it is most certainly French." The
little maid looked rather guilty for a moment. Then she cheered up. This
French that puzzled her must be a local patois.</p>

<p>"Oh, well then," she said. "C'est que je ne suis pas d'ici." (I am not
from this part of the country) and she trotted off up the street.</p>

<p>The landlady and coffee had so fully monopolized our attention that we
had bestowed no more than a passing glance upon the statue of Greuze,
opposite to which we had been sitting. I doubt whether it deserved more.
Surely the most satisfactory monuments to the famous Burgundian
painter are the house in which he was born,<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> the studies from his brush and
pencil, to be seen in the local mus&eacute;e, and the rich meadows by the Sa&ocirc;ne.
All these complete a setting that enables us better to sympathize with
Greuze's fresh and delicate art.</p>

<p>The painter's life, like that of his fellow-Burgundian, Prudhon, fell short
of happiness. Friction with the authorities of the Academy, and the merited
failure of his classical work, "The Emperor Severus and Caracalla"&mdash;the very
title calls up a smile, when we think of it in connection with the painter of
"La Cruche Cass&eacute;e"&mdash;caused him to cease exhibiting at the Salon, until the
Revolution had opened the way for all painters. Yet the apparent failure
was a blessing in disguise; it taught him his limitations, and brought him back
from the stilted manner of his time, to the call of individual genius, and the
freshness of nature.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>He had other troubles; not the least of which was an ill-chosen wife.
Mdlle Babuti, whose charming face he has reproduced on so many canvasses,
was not so easy to live with as her picture, perhaps idealized by the painter,
would lead us to believe; and Greuze himself lacked that touch of philosophy
which would have counterbalanced his natural sprightliness of character.
Finally came the crowning disaster, the Revolution, that robbed him of
nearly all he possessed; so that, though the Convention gave him lodgings in
the vacant chambers at the Louvre, he died in complete poverty. Shortly
before his death, he remarked to his friend, Barth&eacute;lemy:</p>

<p>"At my funeral you will be the poor man's dog."</p>

<p>It is said that Napoleon, hearing of the painter's wretched end, said: "If
I had known his situation, I would have given him a S&egrave;vres vase full of gold,
in payment for all his cruches cass&eacute;es."<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>We need not, in these pages, discuss Greuze's art; but we may recall its
best feature. Though his manner sometimes lays him open to the charge of
being merely pretty and graceful, to the exclusion of greater qualities, we
must not forget that he was one of the first who brought men back to nature&mdash;at
a time when nature was everywhere forgotten&mdash;and reminded them,
beautifully, that the simple incidents of village life, the small joys and sorrows
that swell the breast of the rustic maid over the broken jug, or the welcome
home of her lover, are not less elementally joyful or tragic, not less
worthy the attention and sympathy of the true artist, than scenes of court and
throne, and kindred emotions that, by the caprice of chance, swell the breasts
of kings and decide the destinies of nations.</p>

<p>The idyllic and pastoral effects of Greuze's art, harmonize well with the
unpretentiousness of the town of Tournus, and also with one of its most
delightful features, the meadow-walks that border the Sa&ocirc;ne.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Here, at sunset, when you have gazed your fill at the mysterious towers of
the abbey, rising above the roofs of the town, you may turn to watch the
opalesque lights in the quivering water, that, doubling in its mirror the line
of distant poplars, slides between reedy banks, between wide stretches of
green pasture, where the pale herds browse. Scarcely a sound breaks the
stillness; only, from time to time, comes the chance cry of a roystering
Sunday youth, from a meadow far away floats the lowing of distant cattle,
from the path the heavy tramp of an aged peasant, homeward-bound, bending
beneath the weight of his spade.</p>

<p class="p1">From the river, where, all day long,
around idle punts, tempting baits have been dipping and dropping, comes the
flop of a lazy fish, making rings that widen over the glassy surface. Now
a distant throb is heard, that deepens, as a tug, gaudily painted in red and
black, with white bows, comes gliding down the river, drawing four barges
laden with barrels. The second steamer, reversed in the water beneath, is
hardly less vivid to the eye. Swish! Swish! Swish! The water foams
from the flat prow; all the river is decked with dancing, rainbow ripples,
azure blue below, rose pink above, singing, bubbling, racing one another in
music to the shore.</p>

<p>This pastoral, green plain of the Sa&ocirc;ne, these luscious meadows of
waterish Burgundy, have often recalled to me Phaedra's longing words, in
those last days, when the burden of her life and love was more than she
could bear.</p>

<div class="block3">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, for a deep and dewy spring,</span>

<p>Not less lovely was the same spot next morning, when all the landscape
shone in a light that had in it already something of southern intensity; when
wind and sun were stirring the rushes by the water side, and jewelling the
rippled sweep of the river below the dark towers of St. Philibert. Two gaily-caparisoned
horses, led by a small boy in a black blouse, came plodding
along the towing-path. Two rowers were easing the horses' labours, with
long oars which flashed as they rose and fell. The banks and meadows were
dotted with the same herds of white philosophers, browsing, and lazily
swishing their tails; only, this morning, heads were bent down to the
luscious feast of green, whereas, towards evening, they are lifted, to ruminate
through long hours of dreamy delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">M&acirc;con, to which we paid a flying visit during the interval between two
trains, was once the capital of the M&acirc;connais, until that country was incorporated
with the Duchy of Burgundy. It is now too wholly modern a town
to retain much character or interest. Almost all the ancient houses are
destroyed, and of the two cathedrals&mdash;St. Pierre and St. Vincent&mdash;the
former is wholly modern. The west front of the old church, which
was sacked during the Revolution, remains. Our best impression of M&acirc;con
was the view of the town and river from the train, as it left for Bourg.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Ever since developing a keen interest in the fortunes of the great Burgundian
monasteries, we had decided to take the first opportunity of seeing
the Valley of the Ouche, and Labussi&egrave;re, the adopted daughter of Citeaux.</p>

<p>It was a public holiday; and the train from Dijon was packed with
excursionists. I found myself the only male in a compartment crammed
with eight old ladies, mostly stout, and all in holiday spirits. We fell into
conversation. They all expressed kindly interest in the task that had
brought me to Dijon. I was catechized.</p>

<p>"Has Monsieur seen the prisons of Dijon?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame; je n'aime pas beaucoup ces endroits l&agrave;." Little tinkling
laughs ran all round the carriage.</p>

<p>"But I only just missed seeing them yesterday&mdash;because I had left behind
me my permis de circulation. You have so many regulations in France."</p>

<p>"Talking of regulations, Monsieur," said the stoutest and shrewdest of
the old ladies, with a wicked twinkle in her eye, "Permit me to call to
your attention to the fact that you are in a "Dames seules!"</p>

<p>"Mille pardons, Mesdames; but permit me to observe that I have chosen
my company well."</p>

<p>This time the compartment rang with laughter; and eight bonnetted
heads bobbed in recognition of the courtoisie.</p>

<p>"And if we let him stay, Monsieur will promise to be bien sage?"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Assur&eacute;ment, Mesdames, foi de Lion." So the banter went on, until
our station was called; and in ten minutes we found ourselves lunching in a
meadow of St. Victor, and looking up at the Castle of Marigny perched
upon its rock.</p>

<p>In the time of the first Crusade, Marigny, the great fortress, whose lord
was one of the four most powerful barons of Burgundy, proudly dominated
the valley. Now it is but a charming relic, where you may wander beneath
broken arches and the ivied vaults of great chambers, from whose crannied
floors young fir-trees grow, and bushes hoary with silver lichen. There, too,
you may wile away all a summer day, lying upon mossy, blossom-jewelled
lawns, and dreaming dreams of the great lords of Marigny, and of Brother
Alb&eacute;ric of Labussi&egrave;re, or of Tebsima, the Arab exile, whose bones rest in a
mountain tomb not far away. All the hills hereabout are full of memories
of this most gracious of all Burgundian legends.</p>

<p>Tebsima Ben-Beka (Smile Son of Tears)&mdash;so named because his birth
brought joy and death to his mother&mdash;was a direct descendant of the prophet
himself. Growing up a strong and courageous youth, imbued with a fierce
hatred of all Christians, he fought valiantly for Islam in the great struggle
of the Crescent against the Cross,<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> but was taken prisoner by Guillaume,
Lord of Marigny, at the assault of Jerusalem in 1099. Guillaume, from
the first, was drawn towards his young prisoner, whom he tried earnestly to
convert to the Christian faith. His prayers were heard, and answered by a
wonderful miracle. Tebsima and some companions were present one day,
as spectators at a holy celebration. The officiating priest had pronounced
the sacramental formula, and was elevating the host, when, suddenly, the
sacred emblem was seen by all to change into the form of a young child of
marvellous beauty. All present fell upon their faces. Before the priest
stood a crystal chalice, filled with white wine and water. He took it
between his hands, and spoke the mysterious words. As he did so, the wine
changed to blood. Before the new miracle the hardest heart surrendered.
Tebsima became a Christian.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>In the chalice rested ever after a drop of blood. Guillaume de Marigny
was given the sacred relic by the priest, on condition that he would stay two
years longer in Palestine. This condition he fulfilled; then, taking with
him Tebsima, whose life, as a Christian, was in mortal danger so long as he
stayed in the East, Guillaume set out for France. For three long years his
wife, Matilde, sorrowing, had awaited her lord. Imagine, then, her joy
when, gazing one day from the battlements of the castle, she heard, floating
from far down the valley, the blare of the Crusader's trumpets, then caught
the glint of sun on shining armour, and, at last, the white plume tossing
upon her husband's helmet.</p>

<p>The Holy Tear, as people had learned to name the sacred relic that
Guillaume had brought with him, was placed, with all reverence, in the
tabernacle of the chapel, and every year a solemn f&ecirc;te was celebrated in its
honour. Tebsima, the exile, lived in the Castle of Marigny, where Guillaume
and his lady treated him as their brother. But his heart ached to see
his own people again; and, when the winter cold of Burgundy pierced him
through and through, he longed for the strong suns of the East. So he told
his friends of his resolution, and, despite their protests, returned whence he
came. But his own family, much as they loved him, would not receive him
when they knew the truth. How could the very children of Mahomet
welcome a follower of the Christ? So, after sorrows and adventures,
too many to tell, Tebsima came a second time to the great Castle by the
Ouche. Warm, indeed, was the welcome he received, and great the rejoicing,
when he told how he had sworn never to leave Burgundy again.</p>

<p>One day a brilliant cavalcade was seen riding down the valley. It was
the cort&egrave;ge of Hugues,<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> the Duke of Burgundy, come to celebrate, by a
day's hunting with the lord of Marigny, the safe return of the young Emir.
An hour later the horns sounded the ballad of St. Hubert from the Castle
tower, and the hunt was laid on. A noble stag broke from the thicket.
There was hue and cry down into the valley of Labussi&egrave;re, where the beast
was brought to bay. Suddenly, with a splendid bound, it cleared the baying
hounds, and made furiously for the lady of the castle, who had followed the
hunt. Tebsima, on his Arab steed, that many a time had been his saviour,
saw the danger, and pressed forward. His blade pierced the stag's body up
to the hilt, but not before the terrible horns had buried themselves deep in
the horse's side.<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>The violence of Tebsima's fall, the loss of his horse, that, to an Arab, is
as the loss of a brother, and the chill winds of Burgundy, wrought mortal
harm in the young Arab. Then came a yet greater disaster. It was on the
great day of the veneration of the Sainte Larme. A young page, nobly
dressed in black, came at evening to the castle chapel, and knelt in prayer
before the relic. A moment later the page and the relic had gone. Tebsima,
who first noticed the theft, rode headlong in pursuit. Seeing the black rider
in front of him, he summoned him, by the blood of Christ, to halt; and,
behold, the mule, despite its rider's efforts, stood immovable, as though
changed to stone. Tebsima drew near to the thief, demanded the return
of the relic.</p>

<p>"Since I cannot keep it," said the page, "let it be lost for ever to the
Chapel of Marigny." He hurled the chalice down the face of the rock, and,
drawing his sword, attacked the Emir, who, while avoiding the blow,
plunged his scimitar into the mule's body. The animal bounded into the air;
and man and beast rolled headlong over the brink of the abyss, and were
dashed to pieces on the stones below. Weeping bitterly, Tebsima
descended to seek the fragments of the cup. He found them lying in a
dozen pieces, where a little stream bubbles from the rock. That stream is
called to this day the Fontaine de Sainte Larme; and still its limpid waters
seem to weep the sacrilege its name commemorates.<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The holy relic had vanished for ever. So, with the precious object that
had served always to remind Tebsima of the miracle of his conversion, all
hope in this life departed from the stricken Emir. Feeling himself to be
dying, he left the Castle of Marigny, and withdrew to the pleasant grotto
that by chance he had discovered, near by, in the side of the hill. There he
lived the life of a hermit, giving his mind wholly to devotion and earnest
prayer&mdash;which was granted&mdash;for conversion to the Faith of Christ of his
relatives in the East. There he was visited frequently by the lord and lady
of Marigny, who brought him food, and oil for his lamp. He had another
friend, to whom he told all his story&mdash;the good Alb&eacute;ric, the infirmier at
the neighbouring monastery of Labussi&egrave;re.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Into that grotto of Marigny there entered, one stormy night, a group
of monks. One of them bore the cross of the monastery; another, Brother
Alb&eacute;ric, carried a robe and a scapular. Two novices, torch in hand,
preceded the Abbot, who carried the oil and the holy mysteries. Then they
clothed Tebsima in the robes of the order, and consecrated him to the
service of the church.<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> And so, while a great wind howled through the
hollows of the wooded hills, peacefully, with folded hands, and lips pressed
upon the cross of olive, the new monk passed to the joys of the new life.</p>

<p>The good Alb&eacute;ric had been one of the three brothers who, at the close of
the eleventh century, had founded a little monastery beside the Ouche, in
the lonely vale of Labussi&egrave;re, where three mountain ranges and three
valleys meet.<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> He had once been a rich lord; but, when years of famine
came, he sold all that he had, and gave to the poor and to God; then,
having nothing beside to give, he gave his heart, vowing himself to the
religious life. Virtues such as his soon raised him to the head of the
monastery; but, well though he filled his post, troubles beset his way. Monk
after monk was laid in the cemetery; the cells were empty, and none came
to fill them. All the stream of monastic vocation was turned towards
Citeaux, the then flourishing Abbey, whose fortunes we have already
followed.</p>

<p>One summer night, in 1131, when the tale of the monks of Labussi&egrave;re
had dwindled to the original number, three, a mysterious vision came to
Alb&eacute;ric.</p>

<p>He was walking, on a bright morning, in the monastery garden. Suddenly
he paused before a hive whose tenants seemed to be few and ailing. He
raised the cover; the hive was almost empty. "Poor little bees,"<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> he said,
with a sigh, "What will become of you during the winter?" He thought
of his own convent, and he wept. Suddenly he heard a noise coming from
the mountain, then he perceived a vigorous swarm humming above his head;
and, in a moment, the bees of the valley had come forth to greet their sisters
of the hill. All together entered the hive, and set to work with joyful
hum. Towards the close of the day Brother Alb&eacute;ric lifted the basket. It
was heavy, and already half full. "God be praised," said he. "The
future of the hive is assured." As he awoke, at dawn, he heard a voice
saying to him, "Do as the bees of the valley, and your work shall live."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>At first Alb&eacute;ric did not understand this vision; but the next day, while
giving alms at the gate of the convent, one of the poor told him that a great
fire had destroyed the monastery of Aseraule, whose monks were in dire
distress. This news was a ray of light to Alb&eacute;ric. He told his brother
monks of the dream that had come to him, and of the burning of the neighbouring
monastery. They marvelled greatly, and all knew surely that God's
will bade them summon the Cistercians of the mountain.</p>

<p>In all haste they went to offer aid to their homeless brothers; and there
they met the pious English monk, Stephen Harding, friend of St. Robert,
and St. Bernard's master, who had come to offer the shelter of Citeaux.
Falling at Stephen's feet, and kissing his hand, Alb&eacute;ric begged him to take
into his order himself, his companions, and their monastery. Stephen
willingly consented. He gave to Alb&eacute;ric and his companions the white
robe of Citeaux, and soon after traced with his own hand upon the soil of
Labussi&egrave;re the plan of a new monastic church. Stone by stone the building
grew, until, on the 10th September, 1172, in the presence of a vast assemblage,
before all the clergy and nobles of Burgundy, the new church was
consecrated by Saint Pierre, Archbishop of Tarentaise, who, by prayer and
the laying on of hands, wrought so many miracles of healing that day, that
the people, witnessing these prodigies, shouted, till the three valleys were
echoing with their cries of "Noel, Noel!" The Abbey of Labussi&egrave;re was
well founded at last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A great part of the Abbey buildings still remain, restored almost beyond
recognition, and transformed into a magnificent mansion, now in the occupation
of a family whose name I have forgotten. To our great regret we were
unable to see the house, as the gardien had vanished, taking the keys with
him; so we had to content ourselves with glimpses of glorious Gothic
arcades, Romanesque staircases, and a west front, apparently of the fifteenth
century, with a flamboyant door. But much of the building may be entirely
new, for all I know.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon that we rode into Labussi&egrave;re, and as we had
to get on to Bligny that night, very little time was left in which to do more
than explore the church, a thoroughly good sample of Cistercian severity,
of the eleventh or twelfth century, with a square apse. It has some fine
tombs, and Gothic monumental slabs. Dining that night in the "Cheval
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Blanc" at Bligny, where the host served to us, at half an hour's notice, a
dinner that the Carlton could not have bettered, for hungry men, we
agreed that it would not be easy to find a more charming <i>pays</i> than the
valley of the Ouche, in which to pass a lazy fortnight, tracing out some of
its hundred legends, and steeping oneself in its romantic past.</p>

<p>The road to Arnay-le-Duc, without being more than ordinarily interesting,
gives you some fine views over the C&ocirc;te d'Or. You pass through
Antigny-le-Chatel, where there is a fine ruin on a hill, and below it a later
ghostly castle of the 14th or 15th century, with the high-pitched roof of the
period, and a round tower. At Froissy, entering an inn in search of d&eacute;jeuner,
we found a wedding in full swing. Through a glass panelled door we could
see half a dozen perspiring couples scuffling round what would be described in
England as the bar parlour. We were detected at once; hot faces were
pressed against the glass, while Madame produced an armful of bread, and
some cheese on a broken plate.</p>

<p>"Par ici, m'sieur et dame," said she; "Vous serez mieux dans la charmesse."
She opened the panelled door, and, one carrying the bread, and the other the
cheese on a broken plate, we walked in grand procession through the ballroom&mdash;so
shaking with our inward mirth that the cheese nearly came to
grief. The poor bride, however&mdash;a study in sticky purple and white, not
good to look upon&mdash;did not relish the joke; she scowled upon the intruders;
but madame seemed glad to have us&mdash;and ready to talk to us, as we sat in
the charmesse&mdash;a little dusty, rickety arbour, through which the south wind
was blowing clouds of dust.</p>

<p>"That castle over there. Oh! no one has lived in it these many years
now, except rats. You can't tax them. You see the Government put
such heavy taxes upon the castles that they just drive people away. There's
not a habited ch&acirc;teau now in all C&ocirc;te d'Or. And what weather! Such a
wind! Nous n'avons plus de saisons en Bourgogne."</p>

<p>"Whose wedding is this?" said my wife, looking towards the ballroom
bar-parlour.</p>

<p>"Oh that's my nephew; he is a vigneron, and a good lad. Is madame
married, and has she children? No children! Then madame, je vous souhaite
un beau fils."</p>

<p>As for me, I was speculating on the market price of rat-poison, of castles
in the C&ocirc;te d'Or, and on the squeezability of the French government in the
matter of assessments.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Few incidents in life give more pleasure than happy discovery. That is
why we so much enjoyed Arnay-le-Duc. We just found it out, by instinct,
or by chance. For nobody knows about it; not even the learned people who
write guide-books. And as for the motorists; they come in with the darkness,
and go out with the dawn&mdash;"Must be at Dijon by ten."</p>

<p>In all France I do not know a richer study in warm, red roof-colours than
towered Arnay, seen at sunset from the high land on the road to Saulieu, nor
a more satisfying example of the outlines of a ramparted Gothic-Renaissance
town. Nor, as is sometimes the case, does close acquaintance disenchant
you. Wander through its streets, and prove for yourself that it is one of the
most unspoiled places in all Burgundy. There is something good at every
turn&mdash;a high-pitched, pierced, white gable, from which black window-eyes
look out upon a dark, brown-green, mottled roof touched with red; a wall
with a warm tiled hood; a glimpse, through a trefoiled gate, of a miniature
Renaissance garden, with box and ivy edged borders, fruit trees jewelled with
white blossom, and a lovely, pierced balustrade, leading up to a Kate-Greenaway
House.</p>

<p class="pmb1">But these are the town's less substantial, and less obvious attractions.
Plain for all to see are the flamboyant church with its octagonal lantern, and,
at the back of it&mdash;best approached by a charming staircase such as we have
neither time nor skill to design now-a-days&mdash;the old round tower of the
Motte Forte. In the central <i>Place</i> is a charming white, turretted, and
gabled house, reminding one of the Colombier at Beaune, and close to it,
beside the March&eacute;, are fifteenth-century, cupid-bow windows, and an old
Gothic arch leading into a Gothic courtyard. Some of the houses have
curious stone benches before them, with lovely round and square-edged
mouldings, and everywhere are quaintly designed handles and knockers of
forged ironwork. The women, too, it seemed to us, were less heavy in
feature, and more spirituelle, than in other parts of Burgundy. The
naughtiest of all the naughty children who crowded and criticised round my
wife's easel, was a beautiful blonde girl. We reproved her pranks more
often than those of the others&mdash;because she looked so lovely when she
blushed.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_181.jpg" width="478" height="660" alt="Arnay-le-Duc; Corner House, sixteenth century" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Another attractive spot in Arnay is the walk, by a red path, between the
towering, moss-grown, grey-brown ramparts, where in autumn the wallflowers
blow. Good company, too, are the willow-fringed, elder-shaded
stream, across which you have a glimpse of garden and orchard, and the green
slopes over which anxious ganders take their fluffy yellow children out for
exercise.</p>

<p>But I have not yet mentioned the building that many of the locals, including
the landlord of the Cheval Blanc at Bligny, regard as the crowning glory
of Arnay; and that is the splendid, transitional, Gothic-Renaissance manoir
of the Ducs de Burgogne; though, of course, the landlord of the Cheval
Blanc does not know it is anything of the kind. For him it is the Limier or
file-factory&mdash;the best in all France. For us it is a defiled manoir&mdash;still
showing traces of ancient loveliness, in slated turret, snake-skin roof, and
daintily-carved friezes above the ruined dormer-windows.</p>

<p>Yes: this place is good to wander in. Here comes an old man followed
by a flock of tinkling goats. He stops before a house, and knocks at the
door. The tinkling stops, too. Then a cup is handed out to him, to be
filled from an accommodating goat. He hands it back quite full of warm
milk. The door slams; the tinkling begins again.</p>

<p>A very ancient, bent, bearded man, ragged and dirty, was sitting munching
bread, on the steps that lead down from the <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>"Would you like to give him half a franc?" I said to my wife. She
would, very much. In a moment the two were in conversation.</p>

<p>"Why do you give me this?" said the old man, looking down at the coin
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Because we saw you having d&eacute;jeuner yesterday, and were interested.
This is for to-day."</p>

<p>"It is much for one who is poor. Are you French?"</p>

<p>"No, English."</p>

<p>"All the English are rich. Are you selling things here?"</p>

<p>"No: I am making pictures for a book my husband is writing."</p>

<p>"Ah! you gain much by that?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. But we like it: we did a book on Provence once."</p>

<p>"Ah Provence. I know Provence. I am from the Basses Alpes. I like
Provence very much; you get such good wine there."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Now I must go back to the Caf&eacute;&mdash;and finish <i>my</i> wine."</p>

<p class="pmb1">"Yes, and I'll finish mine." He put his head under the pump, and
drank.</p>

<p class="p1">Then there was the Hotel Chr&eacute;tien, as I think it was called; an establishment
rather casually run, but marked by a bonhomie and insouciance that
enlivened the monotony of wet days. The commercial travellers made
themselves very much at home with Madame and the waitress. One of
these gentlemen, in particular, subjected the latter to a flow of chaff that
ceased not even with the coffee. He always began with a request to her to
recite the m&eacute;nu aloud, and whenever a lull came, he would turn to her, and
say in the most innocent tone:</p>

<p>"By the way, Madamoiselle, what have we to eat this evening?"</p>

<p>"Is Monsieur stone deaf?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Mademoiselle; only hungry. And I like to regulate appetite
by the dishes that are coming!"</p>

<p>Dessert came on. The voluble one cut an apple in half. It was rotten.
"Hey, Mademoiselle; regardez-moi &ccedil;a. Il y en a une qui marche (There's
one walking)."</p>

<p>"So I see. He would willingly be quit of Monsieur."</p>

<p>The other men would sit round sniggering&mdash;and occasionally chipping
in; but they seldom got the better of the maid, who had a fund of repartee
that I have rarely heard matched, even in France.</p>

<p class="pmb3">From this house of frivolity and good cooking&mdash;the chef had been seven
months at the Carlton&mdash;hence enough quite incomprehensible jargon to
warrant the legend "English spoken" on the hotel omnibus&mdash;we made some
good excursions over the undulating country that lies around Arnay; through
miles of spring woods where brave nightingales sang on a spray before your
very eyes; by lofty green uplands, through plateaux, suggestive of Normandy,
where the cattle and the lady's-smock dapple with splashes of white
and mauve the rich green meadows; where the cloudless skies are mirrored
in bluer than English ponds, and peasants' sabots clatter through the most
tangle-wood villages of France; wide silences where your eye can roam all
ways, along the distant hills shimmering in silver and blue, quivering with
living light, to majestic Ch&acirc;teau-Neuf of Philippe Pot, and the tower-crowned
castles of other lords of ancient Burgundy.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Of the thousand who pass through the town annually, on their way to
Switzerland or the Riviera, only a small percentage, probably, know Dijon
as the ancient capital of the Duchy of Burgundy; fewer still have any
conception of the vanished glories it stands for; or could name the three
commodities&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash;and the principal industry upon
which the prosperity of the modern city is based.</p>

<p>From the early middle ages to the closing years of the Capetian Dukes,
from 1032 to 1364, the essential history of Burgundy is centred rather round
the religious communities of Cluny and Citeaux, than in the ducal courts of
Auxerre or of Dijon. But upon the advent in that year, of the royal house of
Valois, with Philippe le Hardi, the full light of the most glorious, and by far
the most highly coloured, period of Burgundian history is turned upon the
capital of the Duchy.</p>

<p>Yet the "bonne ville de Dijon," through which Duke Philip rode on
November 26th, 1364, on his way to the solemn function in the cathedral
of St. B&eacute;nigne, was no more than a second-rate city. Not only did it lack
the glories of the Ducal Palace and the Chartreuse de Champmol that he
himself was soon to found, but one would have missed the church of St.
Michel, the Palais de Justice, and many other hotels, palaces, and churches,
that, still standing, make the modern city one of the most interesting in
France. The Dijon of that day was a straggling town of narrow, filthy,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
unpaved streets over whose projecting gables rose the towers and spires of St.
B&eacute;nigne, St. Philibert, Notre Dame, and many another Church. In wet
weather, the mud spurted from under horses' hoofs upon the grimy walls of
the houses on either side of the street, and it is more than probable that the
gorgeously attired courtiers of Philip's procession arrived, splashed up to the
knees, at the abbey.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, even, in 1388, the Duke was annoyed by the dirty
condition of the town, which was such that, in the rains of winter, neither
man nor horse could make progress without great difficulty. Each inhabitant
was consequently compelled to clean and level, at his own cost, the portion
of street on which his house fronted; and a new pavement was then laid
down, at an expense to the Duchy of two thousand golden francs.<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>But, before I tell of modern Dijon, I must say something of the first of
the four great Dukes of the house of Valois, who were to lead Burgundy
through its brief, meteoric career of greatness.<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Philip, brother of Charles V. of France, and uncle of his successor the mad
Charles VI., had deservedly won his title of "Hardi" at the battle of
Poictiers, as Froissart has told us. He was a bold, determined, somewhat
imprudent prince; kindly and good-natured, as is evident from a glance at
the statue upon his tomb; but proud, ambitious, and so addicted to magnificence
that he could leave to his son only debts and the dukedom.<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> His
clothing was wonderful to see, as we may judge by some of the details that
have come down to us. In 1391, when engaged in treaty with the Duke of
Lancaster, uncle of the King of England, he had two coats made for him.
One, of black velvet, was embroidered, on the left sleeve and collar with a
bunch of roses, upon which were growing twenty-two blossoms, of rubies,
or of a single sapphire, surrounded with pearls; and rose-buds also of pearls.
The buttonholes were made with a running embroidery of broom, with the
pods worked in pearls and sapphires&mdash;a souvenir of the ancient order of the
Cosse (Broom-pod),<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> instituted by the Kings of France, and sometimes bestowed
by them as a reward for loyal service. One of the coats was embroidered
also with P and Y interlaced, while the other, of crimson velvet,
showed, on each side, a silver bear, outlined in sapphires and rubies.<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>These bears were more than characteristic of the extravagance of the time;
they were symbolical of the spirit that, possessing France in the closing years
of the thirteenth century, departed only before the exorcisms of La Pucelle.</p>

<p>The wise and noble kings, Edward IV. of England, and Charles V. of
France, had given place to a dullard and a madman; and the people, no less
than the princes, had lost their reason. The feudal system was passing, had
passed; and no new political nor social order had as yet developed in its place.
Nobles of the day, looking back upon the monkish r&eacute;gime and the early
chivalry, could only ape and burlesque the outward splendours of the movements
whose inward spirit and ideals they were wholly incapable of understanding.
It seemed that God, even, to borrow Luther's phrase, weary of
the game, had thrown his cards upon the table.</p>

<p>Such is the significance of the bear upon Philip's mantle. Everywhere
ranged these strange and uncouth beasts. They grinned in long lines from
the eaves of the Churches; with a thousand other fantastic fancies of disordered
imaginations, they met the eye, at every turn, in corridors of royal
palaces, in the reception rooms of baronial halls. Foul jests and foul shapes
leered at the passer-by from the fringes of a scarlet skirt. On a high dame's
rustling sleeve, whose folds swept the ground, were set the notes of a song;
rich doublets blazed with lewd figures, or with strange symbols, improper, if
well understood. Great ladies, wearing long horns upon their heads, jested
with lords whose pointed toes wriggled up into serpent shapes. Art, sanity,
religion were no longer at one. All the pure and natural ornament of early
Gothic work, filched from church and cathedral for the service of base needs,
flaunted, in horrible disguise, in houses of pleasure and ill fame.<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Small wonder that distracted souls, searching in thick darkness for guidance,
for God, and not finding him in life, turned, at last, in despair, to the
great negations, Death and the Devil. God had failed them; evil, at least,
shall not fail them. In a frenzy of false joy they danced the "danse des
morts" in the cemeteries of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Their dear king Charles, even, so beloved of a mad people, was not less
mad than they. Save for occasional lucid intervals, he was a "fou furieux."</p>

<p>"It was great pity, this malady of the king, which held him for long
seasons, and when he ate it was very gluttonously and wolfishly. And he
could not be persuaded to strip himself, and was full of lice, vermin, and
filth. And he had a little piece of iron that he put secretly close to his flesh.
Of which nothing was known. And it had rotted all his poor flesh, and no-one
durst go near him to remedy it.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless there was a physician who said that it must be remedied, else
was he in danger, and otherwise as it seemed to him, there was no hope for
the healing of the malady. And he advised that they should bring ten or
twelve companions disguised, who should be blackened, and each one furnished
beneath, lest he should wound them. And so it was done and the
companions entered very terrible to see, into his chamber. When he saw
them he was much astonished, and they drew nigh to him at once: now there
had been made ready all new clothing, shirt, tunic, cloak, hose, boots, that
they bore with them. They took hold of him, he saying many words to
them the while, then they stripped him and put upon him the said things
that they had brought. It was great pity to see him, for his body was all
eaten with lice and filth. And they found on him the said piece of iron:
every time that they would cleanse him, it must needs be done in this said
manner."<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Such was the France of the closing years of Philippe le Hardi's rule&mdash;King
and country lifting clasped hands, to say, with old Lear: "Not mad, sweet
Heaven, not mad!"</p>

<p>The condition of Burgundy, and especially of its great appanage Flanders,
which Duke Philip had inherited from his wife, though bad, was not so
serious as that of the country in general.</p>

<p>In Dijon there was comparative security&mdash;enough for the establishment,
under Philippe le Hardi, of a new era in Burgundian art. For Philip had great
ideas. He never forgot that he was brother to Charles V. of France. Dijon,
if not to rival Paris, should be at least a capital worthy of its Valois Duke.
This jouisseur raffin&eacute; must have architects, sculptors, and painters; cunning
embroiderers, too, and workers in ivory. But above all, he must have goldsmiths.
They came flocking in from all Flanders. "On s'harnachoit
d'orfavrerie" says Martial d'Auvergne.<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> We have already seen the bear
upon Philip's coat.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>He began, in 1366, with the tower of a new castle&mdash;now the Tour de Bar&mdash;to
replace the ruined ch&acirc;teau of the Capetian Dukes; and followed it,
twelve years later, with a monastery, the Chartreuse de Champnol, at the
gates of Dijon, where he wished to house suitably his monks and his tomb.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_189.jpg" width="230" height="489" alt="Moses; from the Puits de Mo&iuml;se, Dijon" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Chartreuse de Champnol remained
the burial place of the Ducal
house until the 16th century; but it
has not survived to our day. Its
close connection with royal authority
marked it out for the attentions of
the revolutionary mob. The site is
now occupied by an "Asile des
Ali&eacute;n&eacute;es" as the French politely
term a mad-house&mdash;a choice in which
the cynic may detect either a retort
upon rampant democracy, or a sly
allusion to certain congenital failings
of the House of Valois. There is
little to be seen in the Asile des
Ali&eacute;n&eacute;es; but that little is so important
that we decided to go there.
For, in the centre of the old cloister,
was, and is, Claus Sluter's world-famous
sculpture&mdash;Le Puits des
Proph&egrave;tes.</p>

<p>"Puits?" interrogated a sullen
maid, laconically, as she opened to
us. We followed in silence. Truly
the present home of the Well is depressing,
and I wish the authorities
would remove it to a safe and more
cheerful spot in the precincts of the
ducal palace.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>But the work itself, though despoiled, by wind and rain, of the calvary that
crowned it, and though quite denuded of the gold and brilliant colours with
which it once blazed, remains one of the strongest and most impressive pieces
of sculpture in existence. Naturally, as one would expect in the case of a
work completed so early as the sixth year of the fifteenth century, there are
serious and obvious faults&mdash;for instance, the figures are too short, the hands
and feet generally too small, and the drapery, in some points, badly
handled&mdash;but all the personalities are so striking, so individual, the whole is
so strongly grouped, that the effect is more than majestic. As M. Germain
well says: "Il y a un souffle &eacute;pique dans ces figures." Stand for five
minutes before the stern, inflexible face of the law-giver; compare that
statue, mentally, with the Moses of Michael Angelo, to which alone it is
inferior, and you will begin to realize Claus Sluter's genius as a sculptor of
the human face and form. He broke away boldly from primitive and conventional
traditions, and went straight to nature, to the men about him, for
his types. These strong physiognomies and massive forms are eminently
Burgundian.<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>In the portal of the chapel the guide will show you other, and rather
earlier work, generally attributed to Claus Sluter, namely, five statues representing
Philippe le Hardi and his wife Margaret of Flanders, being presented
to the Virgin by Saint Catherine and Saint John. Four of them may
well be from the chisel of the famous sculptor, but I think, with M. Germain,
that the figure of the Virgin is wrongly attributed, chiefly for the
reason that the proportions are much longer than those of other Sluterian
statues.</p>

<p>And what of the man whose genius was to exercise such influence upon
Burgundian art? Little is known of him. He remains an enigmatic,
mysterious figure, living for us only through his work, and that of the school
of which he was the inspiring force. He died in 1406, the same year in
which he had finished his Puits des Proph&egrave;tes; leaving to his nephew, Claus
de Werve, the task of further realizing their new ideals in sculpture.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus
it came about that the second Claus&mdash;an artist not unworthy to follow his
uncle&mdash;was entrusted with the construction of the next great Burgundian
monument we have to consider, the tomb of Philippe le Hardi, now in the
great hall of the mus&eacute;e, once the "salle des gardes" of the Ducal Palace.
The commission had been given originally, in 1384, to Jean de Marville,
who died after completing the masonry and the alabaster gallery. Claus
Sluter made some progress with the <i>pleurants</i>, but it was not completed until
the end of 1410, when young De Werve had been at work upon it for four
years.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_191.jpg" width="300" height="327" alt="Philippe le Bon, Duke of Burgundy" title="" />
</div>

<p>The masterpiece was received with universal acclamations. Jean sans
Peur, with a Valois' eye for the beautiful, recognised the merit of his new
imagier, and commissioned him forthwith to do his (the Duke's) own tomb.
Claus accepted the task, but was never able to get to work. Money lacked;
and the Duke of Burgundy was too deeply involved in the political struggles
of his time to give heed to such trifles as financing the construction of a tomb,
even though it were his own. So poor Claus, filled with a glorious ideal that
he was never able to see realized in stone, wasted his life in waiting, waiting,
until, in 1439, death found
him, poor and unknown, and
laid him in an obscure tomb,
not of his own design, in the
Chartreuse de Champnol. So
fare they who hang upon
princes' favours.</p>

<p>When Jean sans Peur had
expiated, at Montereau, the
crime of which I shall presently
tell, his son, Philippe le
Bon, had perforce to look
about him for another imagier
to do the work. His choice
fell, unwisely, upon a Spaniard
from Aragon, one Jean de
la Huerta, an unscrupulous
rascal, who bolted from Dijon
in 1455, taking with him cash
that he had not earned, and
leaving behind him the tomb, void of sculpture, except the angels and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
tabernacles of the gallery. The monument was completed, in 1466-1470,
by his successor, Antoine le Moiturier, of Avignon.</p>

<p>The revolutionary mob destroyed both monuments; but they were pieced
together again and restored; and there they stand, for all time let us hope,
worthily housed in that magnificent Salle des Gardes. There is nothing in
all Burgundy that so conveys, in one coup d'&oelig;il, the magnificence of the
Valois Dukes.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Philippe le Hardi, clothed in a white robe and a blue mantle lined with
ermine, lies, with folded hands, upon a slab of black marble. Two angels
with outspread wings hold the helmet over his cushioned head, and his feet
rest upon a lion's back. The form and face are realistically done, even to
the veins on the hands. But, so far, all is conventional, traditional. It is
when we look at the white-robed figures beneath the sculptured tabernacles
of the gallery, that we recognise a new motif, dramatic realism, in the monumental
art of the period. Claus Sluter and his nephew had developed the
individuality of portraiture that made the success of the "Puits de Mo&iuml;se."
Their great patron Duke was dead; and all Dijon had followed weeping in
his funeral procession. Claus reproduced that procession, perpetuated it in
living stone. They are all there&mdash;the high functionaries, the praying monks,
the plebeian, wiping his nose on his fingers, all done with a felicity and truth
unequalled in any sculpture that has come down to us. Here is a hooded
mourner comforted by a priest with finger on text, there an obstinate one
receiving exhortation; and an old bourgeois, chin in hand, pondering the way
of life. The attitudes alone are so significant that, though the face be
hidden, you do not wish to look beneath the cowl. Resignation, despair,
faith, argument; all are expressed in pose; the figures behind the pillars are
treated with as much sincerity as those which are fully seen.<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Look up
from them to the figure above their heads, and you will see at once that,
while the angels have only a decorative function, the <i>pleurants</i> are both
decorative and dramatic.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">And what of Jean San Peur's tomb, with which young Claus had dreamed
of outdoing his uncle? A glance will show that, as a whole, it is greatly
inferior to that of the father. The recumbent figure and the decorative
angels are equally well done; are, perhaps, even superior in the matter of
draperies, which were not Sluter's strong point; but the alabaster gallery
lacks the harmonious simplicity of the earlier monument: the detail has been
over-elaborated in the fashion of the period, and in a not unnatural though
ineffectual attempt to improve upon a chef-d'&oelig;uvre. The <i>pleurants</i> directly
imitative of those of Philip's tomb, are, without exception, less natural, less
restrained, and less felicitous. Yet, despite all these faults, the monument
remains a not unworthy companion of its predecessor.</p>

<p>Would we could say that Jean sans Peur himself was equally worthy of
the first Valois Duke. In that case the whole course of French history
might have been different and happier.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 330px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_194.jpg" width="330" height="337" alt="Pleurants from the Tomb of Philippe le Hardi" title="" />
</div>

<p>But the fact is that the Dukes' characters, ethically considered, are of the
same relative merit as are their tombs. The contrast between the features
of father and son is most striking. Philip has an open, almost handsome
face, with a noble,
though very Jewish,
nose, and a generous
mouth revealing
kindliness and good intentions.
Jean's head,
on the contrary, is ill-proportioned,
flatter,
with a weaker chin,
and meaner nose.
The cheek-bones are
too prominent, and the
crafty mouth and eye,
and "disinheriting" expression,
bid the
student of physiognomy
beware.</p>

<p>Yet, stained though
he was by one bloody
crime, we shall judge
wrongly if we conceive
as wholly bad this little ch&eacute;tif, crafty, inarticulate, careful man, who,
in days of unbridled luxury, dared to be seen, like Louis XI., in mended
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
clothes, and never risked large sums at play.<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> He was a working
prince&mdash;brave, intelligent, interested; with his finger always upon the pulse
of public opinion. A hardy campaigner, he knew how to endure patiently
hunger and thirst, heat and cold, rains and winds; and he possessed the gift,
inestimably valuable in those days, of winning and holding the loyal devotion
of his immediate friends and servants.<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Looking at him, lying there robed, upon royal marble, one's mind returns
to the foul murder that for thirty years held France in misery, and drenched
her fair fields in blood&mdash;a deed that robbed the doer of all happiness, and
darkened the after years of his life with the shadow of impending death,
until a revenge, not less cowardly in conception, nor less pregnant with
calamity, loosed again civil war upon France, and humbled the distracted
country beneath a foreign dominion.</p>

<p>For some considerable time before the murder, hatred, bitter though concealed,
had existed between Jean sans Peur and Louis, Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, the
brother of King Charles VI. Louis, himself a poet, was a pretty, wayward,
loose-living, irresponsible, and charming personality, gifted with that fantastic
grace of the early renaissance that is so pleasing in his son, Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans,
the singer of Blois. Louis, naturally, was beloved of all ladies, and in spite
of his faults&mdash;if not because of them, since they were gracious ones&mdash;was
liked, even by the priests whom he cajoled, and by the commoners whom he
oppressed.</p>

<p>The spirited youngster, with an eye upon his Burgundian rival, had taken
for his device a knotty cudgel and the words "Je l'envie" (I defy). Jean
sans Peur, knowing well at whom that shaft was aimed, retorted by adopting
for himself a plane, with the motto, "Je le Tiens" (I hold it), thereby
intimating his intention of planing down that cudgel. None guessed how
soon he would do so.</p>

<p>Though each prince wore his device openly, and displayed it broadcast on
robe, banner, and pennon, they were brought together, and there was sworn
reconciliation between the pair. On the 20th November, 1407, they heard
mass, and took the sacrament side by side. Two days later the princes
attended a great dinner given by the Duc de Berri. After the feast they
embraced, drank to each other, and again swore friendship.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen, who was lodging at the time in a little hotel in the old Rue
du Temple, near the Porte Barbette, had recently given birth to a still-born
child. On November 23rd, the duke of Orleans, always on the best of
terms with his sister-in-law&mdash;popular rumour, indeed, made her his mistress&mdash;came
to offer his condolences, and supped with her in that house. The gay
meal was interrupted by the advent of a suborned valet de chambre of the
king, summoning the duke immediately to the royal presence.</p>

<p>"Il a h&acirc;te de vous parler," said the messenger, "pour chose qui touche
grandement &agrave; vous et &agrave; lui."<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The Duke, nothing doubting, ordered his mule to be brought without
delay, and, though he had six hundred armed men in Paris, set out, unaccompanied,
except by two squires, mounted upon the same horse, and four
or five valets on foot carrying torches. It was about eight o'clock in the
evening; the night was overcast (assez brun), and the street deserted. The
Duke, dressed in a simple costume of black damask, rode slowly down the
old Rue du Temple, singing, and playing with his glove. As he was passing
before the house of the Mar&eacute;chal de Rieux, no more than a hundred paces
distant from the Queen's apartments, a company of about twenty armed men,
in ambuscade behind a house called L'Image Notre Dame, broke out upon
the little party. The horse on which were the two squires, startled by the
noise, took fright, and galloped away down the street. With cries of "&Agrave;
mort! &agrave; mort!" the assassins fell upon the Duke, and one of them struck
him a blow with an axe that cut off his hand.</p>

<p>"What is this?" cried Louis. "Who are all these? I am the Duc
d'Orl&eacute;ans."</p>

<p class="pmb1">"'Tis you whom we want" (C'est ce que nous demandons) replied the
assailants. In a moment, a storm of blows, from sword, axe, and spiked club,
brought him down from his mule. He rose upon his knees, but, before he
could recover himself, his head was split open, and his brains were streaming
over the pavement. "And they turned him over and over, and so terribly
hammered him that he was soon dead and piteously slain." A young page,
who sought to defend his master, was likewise struck down; another,
grievously wounded, managed to escape into a little shop in the Rue des
Rosiers.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">At that very hour, Jaquette, the wife of a poor cobbler, was in her room,
high above the street, awaiting her husband's return. While taking in a
garment that had been hanging out of the window to dry, she saw a nobleman
pass by on horseback, and, a moment after, while putting her child to
bed, she heard the shouts of "&Agrave; mort! &agrave; mort!" She ran to the window
with her child in her arms, and, throwing open the casement cried, "Au
meurtre, au meurtre!" "Taisez-vous mauvaise femme!" cried one who
noticed her, and arrows rattled upon the wall of the house. A moment
later, all was over. A big man in a red chaperon drawn down over his eyes,
who seemed to be the leader, shouted, "Put out all lights, and let us be off;
he is dead!" Some sprang on to their horses which were in waiting at the
gates of the Maison Notre Dame, and with a last blow or two at the lifeless
body of the Duke, they made off, mounted and on foot, crying, "Au feu!
au feu!" in response to the cries of "murder" raised by some of the Duke's
men who had come upon the scene.</p>

<p>The assassins had set fire to the Maison Notre Dame. As they fled, they
threw down behind them iron traps to prevent pursuit, and coerced terrified
shopkeepers into extinguishing the lights in the shops along their route.
The Duke's men found their master in a pitiable plight. The skull lay open
in two places, the left hand was cut off, and the right arm was almost
severed. Beside the dead Duke, the young German page, Jacob, lay gasping
out his life.</p>

<p>"Ah! mon ma&icirc;tre, ah! mon ma&icirc;tre!" Il se complaignoit moult fort,
come s'il vouloit mourir.<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>When it was known that the murdered body of young Louis of Orl&eacute;ans
was lying in the Hotel de Rieux, all Paris was in consternation. Death
veiled his faults from the people. They could see only his virtues. A
prince so gallant and debonair, to die so young! the pity of it! Women
and men, noble and base-born, wept for him, so foully slain. Did not even
his great rival of Burgundy echo their grief?<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>"Never" was he heard to say, "was more wicked nor traitorous murder
committed nor executed in his kingdom."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_199.jpg" width="150" height="360" alt="Pleurant" title="" />
</div>

<p>At the solemn funeral in the
Church of the C&eacute;lestins, Jean sans Peur was one of those who bore the pall.<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
He was to bear that pall for the remainder of his life.<a id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Of hundreds who
watched him there, clothed in deep mourning, and weeping bitterly,<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> how
many guessed the truth. Yet the truth was
not long concealed. When the hue and cry
was raised, it soon became known that the
assassins had fled towards Rue Mauconseil,
where was the Palace of the Duke of Burgundy;
and the Provost of Paris suggested
that he could soon lay hands on his men, were
he permitted to search the hotels of the
Princes. Then the Duke of Burgundy's
countenance was observed to pale. Drawing
aside the Duke of Berri and the King of
Sicily, he whispered to them: "'Twas I, the
Devil tempted me." They shrank from him;
the Duke of Berri burst into tears. "I have
lost both my nephews," he murmured.</p>

<p>A few hours later the scene was changed.
Pride had conquered remorse in the heart of
Jean sans Peur. Denied access to the Council,
the murderer mounted horse, and galloped
ventre &agrave; terre, into Flanders, there to steel his
conscience against a deed which was to darken
his shortened days with the shadow of impending death,
and for thirty years was to drench the
fields of France in the blood of her best.</p>

<p>The absent Duke entrusted to a certain learned doctor of Theology, Jean
Petit, the duty of whitewashing his master&mdash;a task less formidable than it
sounds to those unversed in the casuistry of the schools of that day. To do
Petit justice, he seems to have acquitted himself as well as the obvious
weakness of his case would permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Starting from the principal that it is "licit
and meritorious to slay a tyrant traitorous and disloyal to his king and
sovereign lord," he proceeded to show, to his own satisfaction, that the
murder of the "criminal" Duke of Orleans "was perpetrated for the very
great good of the king's person, and that of his children and all the kingdom,"
and held that the king should not only be pleased thereat, but should pardon
the Seigneur de Bourgogne, "and remunerate him in every way, that is to
say in love, honour, and riches, following the example of remunerations made
to Monseigneur Michael the Archangel and the valiant man Phineas."</p>

<p>This extraordinary document, which, to the modern mind, is a jumble of
unconscious humour and deliberate blasphemy, aroused, not unnaturally,
"much murmuring within the town of Paris." The quarrel was taken up
far and wide, and soon all France was divided into two camps, the Armagnacs,<a id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
known by the white scarf, and the Burgundians, whose badge was
the Cross of St. Andrew.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_200.jpg" width="160" height="160" alt="Ornament" title="" />
</div>

<p>We have no space in which to follow here the varying fortunes of the two
parties. For long years, in town and country, they fought it out; the
children of the villages with fists, feet, stones, and sticks; their elders in the
towns, with sword, dagger, and club. In the autumn of 1418 the Burgundians
effected an entry into Paris, and the
excited mob commenced an indiscriminate
slaughter of their opponents. Two presidents
of parliament, magistrates, bishops, even,
fell. Sixteen hundred persons perished in a
day. They were slain in the prisons, they
were slain in the street. "Did you see your
enemy passing on the other side of the way,
you had but to cry "&Agrave; l'Armagnac" and he
was dead." A woman, about to become a
mother, was ripped open; within her dead
body, as she lay in the street, the child could
be seen to move. "Vois donc," said the canaille, "this little dog still stirs."
But none durst take the child. No Burgundian priest would baptise a little
Armagnac. Why should he save an enemy's brat from damnation?</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"The children played with the corpses in the streets. The body of the
Constable and others lay for three days in the palace, a butt for the jests of
the passers by. Some of them remembered to take a strip of skin from his
back, so that he, too, might wear in death, the white emblem of the living
Armagnacs." At last the stench forced them to throw all the debris into
the tomberaux; thence, without priest or prayer, into an open ditch in the
pig-market.<a id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>These closing years of the reign of the mad king,<a id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> from 1418 and on to
1425, were the darkest in all the history of France. War, famine, pestilence,
three grim spectres, stalked over the land. Every evening a starving
crowd surged round the bake-houses of Paris. In all the town were heard
the piteous lamentations of little children crying: "Je meurs de faim!"
Upon a dung-heap, thirty boys and girls died of hunger and cold. The dog-knacker
was followed by the poor, who, as he slew, devoured all, "chair et
trippes."<a id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Nor were things better without the town. The fields, deserted
by their normal labourers, were re-peopled with wolves, that, scouring the
country in great packs, grew fat upon the corpses they scratched up. The
people lived only in the woods and the fortresses; the towns teemed with
men at arms; all culture was abandoned, except around the ramparts, within
sight of the sentry upon his tower. When the enemy appeared upon the
horizon, the sound of the tocsin moved man and beast, by a common instinct,
to seek shelter within the walls.<a id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Hunger made brigands of all.</p>

<p>France was receiving at the hand of God full measure for all her sins.
The dead man's pall, that Jean sans Peur had been bearing through twelve
wretched years of misery and blood, were soon to cover his own mangled
body. Murder, as of old, was to breed murder. He who had taken the
sword, was to perish by it.</p>

<p>Several attempts, more or less futile, had been made to patch up a reconciliation
between the Duke of Burgundy and the Orleanist Dauphin, a boy of
sixteen years. In the autumn of the year 1419, a meeting was arranged to
be held in a long, wooden gallery, specially erected on the bridge of Montereau,
at the junction of the Seine and the Yonne.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Burgundy's fortunes at
this time were at a low ebb, and the Dauphin's principal counsellors thought
the time had come to deal their enemy a crushing blow. The rumour of
their intention spread, and Jean was warned many times of his danger; but
he made light of it. In vain his servants assured him that a plot was laid,
that he was going to his death. He would not listen. At the last moment,
however, he seems to have felt some compunction; for he delayed his coming
so long that Tanneguy du Chatel was sent to fetch him. The duke hesitated
no more. "This is he in whom I trust," said he, and he laid his hand
upon du Chatel's shoulder.</p>

<p>The accounts of the final scene differ materially; the exact truth will probably
never be known. On coming into the Dauphin's presence, the Duke
removed his velvet cap, and kneeling, made a profound obeisance. Hardly
had he risen to his feet when a confused m&ecirc;l&eacute;e arose, and the young Dauphin
was led off to the Castle of Montereau. Meanwhile the assassins had got to
work. The first blow passed down the right side of the Duke's face, and
cut off the hand with which he sought to ward off the stroke. The second
pierced his heart, when, "with a sigh and a movement of the loins,"
he fell. The abandoned body was buried by the cur&eacute; of Montereau in the
town cemetery, where it was found, several weeks after, clothed only in
hose, doublet, and breeches. "A piteous thing to see, and no man there
could refrain from weeping."<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Thus the Duke of Orleans was avenged; but the act, as might have been
expected, only raised the fallen fortunes of the party it was intended finally
to destroy.</p>

<p class="pmb1">As it had been with his victim, so, in turn, it was with Jean. Death
expiated the murder, and veiled the murderer's faults. The many, who had
been lukewarm for Burgundy, returned to their allegiance again.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>


<p class="p2">After this long historical digression, it is quite time that we returned to
the Salle des Gardes, where there are many good things to be seen beside the
tombs of the Dukes. Not the least interesting are the ducal portraits, all
very Jewish, and bearing a strong family likeness. In the picture gallery
adjoining is a portrait of Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire, by Van Hemerren, done, it is
said, shortly before his death at Nancy. Here is Valois madness, indeed;
shown in the wildly staring eyes, the furrowed brow, the pursed lips, the
poised head, the spread hands, and straying fingers&mdash;a mind and body in
extreme of tension. What brought the last of the Valois Dukes to such a
pass? Readers who do not know will discover, when we come to talk of&mdash;the
Post Office!</p>

<p>Upon the many other things worth seeing in that Salle des Gardes, I have
no time to dwell; also the reader will find them catalogued in any guide.
But one or two I will mention. The most striking of all, perhaps, is the
magnificent chimney-piece, built in 1504, after the great fire, which, in 1502,
destroyed all the decorations and the original ceiling of the chamber. On
the walls are two gorgeous altarpieces in wood-gilt, done by a Flemish artist,
Jacques de Baerze, to the order of Philippe le Bon, in 1391. The subjects of
one are: The Execution of John the Baptist, The Martyrdom of St.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Catherine; and the Temptation of St. Anthony. Those of the other
include the Adoration of the Magi, Calvary, and the Entombment. All the
figures, especially the Roman soldiery, in very medi&aelig;val clothing, playing
dice for Christ's vesture at the foot of the Cross, and the weeping relatives,
are treated with the usual vivacity and realism of the Burgundian school; the
whole is decorated with flamboyant Gothic detail of richness unrivalled, so
far as I am aware, by any similar work, excepting, possibly, the famous
r&eacute;table at the Eglise de Brou. The painting and gilding of the volets is by
Melchior Broederlam, court painter to Philippe le Hardi.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_204.jpg" width="280" height="374" alt="Dijon Museum; Woman at Prayer" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are also two charming sixteenth century renaissance doors, from the
Palais de Justice, carved with the most perfect arabesques, and a torso by
Hugues Sambin, the famous architect who built the curious fa&ccedil;ade of the
Eglise St. Michel. The guide will point out to you, in the centre cabinets,
St. Bernard's Cup, the cross of his
friend St. Robert, who received him
when he first came to Citeaux, and
other good relics, including a cast of
a skull, said to be that of Jean sans
Peur, with a slit in it&mdash;the slit
through which the English entered
France, as our guide sagely remarked.
The epigram earned for
him the respect due to an homme
instruit, until he proffered the information
that the &eacute;glise Notre Dame
is not a thirteenth century church!</p>

<p>If you want to get an idea of Dijon
in medi&aelig;val times, study the sixteenth
century tapestry in this salle.
It shows a walled city with many
churches, most of which have now
disappeared. Indeed, with the exception
of the Tour du Logis du Roi, or
Tour de la Terrasse, beneath which
you are standing at the moment, very few of the buildings are easily recognisable.
The subject represents the siege of the City by the Swiss. The black
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
virgin, now, I believe, in the Eglise Notre Dame, has been borne out to
assist in the relief of the City, and the mayor of the town is in negotiation
with the enemy. They covenanted to raise the siege for a specified sum;
but were foolish enough to depart without the cash, which, consequently
was never paid.</p>

<p>The remainder of the mus&eacute;e installed in the Palace has little that is of
first-rate interest, except, the ducal kitchen, some good Burgundian altarpieces,
and a large collection of modern statues, chiefly by the Burgundian
Rude (1784-1855).<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Among hundreds of inferior pictures, I was most
interested in three paintings of Dijon Castle, in salle 8, by G. P. H. Jeanniot.
Dijon Castle does not now exist. If the reader can endure more history, I
will tell him the reason why.</p>

<p>If you will walk down the Rue de la Libert&eacute;, in this town, and turn, two
hundred yards or so below the arch, along one of the narrow streets to the
left, you will emerge on to a large <i>place</i>, in the centre of which stands a
great, white building. That white building, the Post Office, occupies the
site of the Castle, which, until a few years ago, stood as a memento of the
end of the Valois Dukes. Dijon, however, now grown to be a great and
prosperous city, a centre of the wine trade, is more concerned with the
development of her industries than with her historical monuments; consequently,
when a new Post Office was needed, the authorities came to the
conclusion that a castle so centrally situate must go.<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> It went: but its
memories remain. Its story is that of the final struggle between Burgundy
and France, between Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire and Louis XI., respective
champions of the old order and the new.<a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>These rivals were not well matched. It was the unequal combat of the
matador against the bull. Charles, though a prince of great charm and
ability, endowed with the dual qualities of scholar and general, was still but
a man of his time. If he possessed the virtues of the middle ages&mdash;courage,
daring, resolution,&mdash;he shared also its defects&mdash;pride, obstinacy, shortsightedness,
boundless ambition, and a touch, perhaps, of the hereditary insanity
of the House of Valois. Dreams of more than feudal glory, of
empire, even, dazzled him.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>His father had been "Philip the Good"; the son
should be Alexander the Great. "Si grand et si puissant qu'il put &ecirc;tre conducteur
et meneur des autres." He would re-establish in greater glory, with
wider bounds, the ancient Kingdom of Burgundy. And France! He
reckoned without France. It was not within the power of this man to
fathom nor to play move for move against such an opponent as Louis. He
had held the king in his grasp once,<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and had let him go. The opportunity
would never recur.</p>

<p>Patient, untiring Louis, touched, just as his rival was, with insanity,
endowed with more than the common cunning of his type, possessed a mind
as modern, almost, in essentials, as was that of Bacon half a century later.
He foresaw clearly enough the coming death of feudalism, and, while waiting
wolf-like, to prey upon the corpse, he bent his mind to the wider constructive
processes of a subtler, more Machiavellian policy.</p>

<p>The reigning princes of Europe were old; Louis, noting the fact, realized
that he had only to wait, leaving the active part to his ally, Death, a power
as certain as God's, and one, moreover, that he need not cajole with prayers,
nor bribe with silver balustrades. He waited, while the black angel shook
the tree; then he gathered the plums as they fell: and France was his.</p>

<p>King Charles, meanwhile&mdash;king in all but name&mdash;was burning to fight
all comers. He flung himself first upon the Swiss, who were in league
against him. He was defeated at Grandson, and again at Morat, on the 22nd
June, 1476, losing many men and much spoil, including his great diamond,
one of the largest in Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> He lost heart, too, and retired into
solitude, letting his beard grow, and dreaming of revenge. There was to be
no revenge for him.</p>

<p>On the 22nd October, he commenced the siege of Nancy, which he
prosecuted with quiet energy, until, in the following January, he heard that
the Swiss were advancing against him to the relief of the town. The
doomed Duke turned to meet them, and his fate. His army, wearied by
much campaigning, was completely routed. The following day Duke
Charles could not be found; various rumours were current in the town
concerning him.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>He was dead; he was not dead. "Beware," said the timid ones, "lest
you behave otherwise than if he were yet alive, for his vengeance will be
terrible on his return." On 6th January there was brought to Duke Ren&eacute;,
a young page, named Jean Baptiste Colonna, who said he had seen his
master fall, and could find the place. The next day they recommenced
their search for the body. The page led them to a pond called the Etang
de St. Jean, distant about three culverin shots from the town. There, half-buried
in the mud-banks of a little stream, near a chapel, lay a dozen
despoiled corpses. "They commenced to search all the dead; all were
naked and frozen, scarcely could one know them; the page, passing here
and there, found many mighty ones, and great and small, white as snow.
And all turned them over. 'Alas!' said he, 'Here is my good master.'"<a id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Others gathered round. As they lifted the head from the ice to which
it had frozen, the skin was torn from the face. Already the wolves and
dogs had been at work upon the other cheek; moreover a great wound had
split the head from the ear to the mouth.<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>In such condition the corpse was not easily recognisable, but Olivier de
la Marche and others identified it by the teeth and the nails, and by certain
marks, such as the scar of the wound received at Montlh&eacute;ri. When they
had washed the body in warm water and wine, it was easily recognised by
all. In addition to the wound in the head, there were two others, one
through the thighs, and another below the loins. The dead Duke was
borne into the town, and placed in a velvet bed beneath a canopy of black
satin. The corpse was clothed in a camisole of white satin, and covered
with a crimson mantle of the same material. A Ducal crown was laid on
the head, scarlet shoes and golden spurs upon the feet. "The said Duke
being honourably clothed, he was white as snow; he was small and well-limbed;
on a table, well wrapped up in white sheets, upon a silk pillow, on the
head a red cap set, the hands joined, the cross and holy water beside him;
all who would might see him, none were turned away; some prayed God
for him, and others not." The victorious Ren&eacute;, Duke of Lorraine, came
to throw holy water upon the body of the unhappy prince.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>He took the
hand beneath the coverlet; tears came into his eyes. "Ah! dear cousin,"
said he, "may God receive your soul, you have brought on us many an
ill and many a sorrow." Then he kissed the hand, fell upon his knees,
and remained for a quarter of an hour in prayer.<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Louis XI. made no attempt to conceal his rejoicing over the tragedy of
Nancy. A silver balustrade, weighing 6,776 marks, erected around the
tomb of St. Martin de Tours, testified his gratitude to the heavenly powers,
who had removed the rival of the most Christian King. Then, with
great energy, he proceeded to support his claim to Burgundy. Towns were
occupied; rebels and seditious persons were executed and proscribed, and a
castle was erected at the gates of Beaune, in addition to that at Dijon.
Both were occupied by royal garrisons responsible for the subjection of the
country.</p>

<p>On July 31st, 1479, the king made his solemn entry into Dijon. "The
mayor, the &eacute;chevins, the procureurs, clothed in scarlet robes, walked before
him, as they had formerly walked before the Dukes; the clergy in their
chapes bore the holy relics. Louis proceeded first to the Abbey of St.
B&eacute;nigne, where the Dijonnais swore fealty to him, as to their natural lord,
and prayed him to hold them in his good grace; then, preceded by trumpets,
tambourines, and minstrels, he went to lodge at the Ducal Palace. Everywhere
they covered with lime the arms of Burgundy, broke the windows of
the Chambre Des Comtes which bore that device, and replaced it by that of
the King with the cord of St. Michael and the arms of the Dauphin."<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p class="pmb1">So ended the power of Burgundy. From the days of Philippe le Hardi,
onwards, there had arisen in the minds of those proud dukes&mdash;who were
more than dukes&mdash;a dream of a new kingdom that should exceed in extent
and in dominion the old Burgundy of their fathers&mdash;a kingdom, an empire,
perhaps, freed for ever from the hated rivalry of the Fleur-de-lys. But
that dream was not to be realised. All the conditions, geographical,
historical, psychological, were against them; nor had the dukes themselves,
for all their abilities, the constructive minds necessary for the accomplishment
of such a task. Louis, on the other hand, as we have seen, possessed
such a mind; and destiny and death, as though consciously realizing the fact,
worked for him. Burgundy was no more than the greatest of the fruits that
fell into his lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Nevertheless, we shall surely do well to remember these years, and these
Dukes, that went to the making of France. Dijon, it appears, proud of
her mustard, and of her wine-begotten prosperity, does not care to remember.
She has pulled down the unworthy memento of subjection. Truly
she has her reward. She has the best Post Office in the Duchy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, after all this history, what of Dijon as it is to-day? Well,
modern Dijon, despite the ever-to-be-deplored demolition of the Castle,
remains one of the most individual and fascinating of French towns&mdash;a
cheerful, lively, bustling little city, full of fine buildings, and unexpected
architectural surprises of the Renaissance and earlier times. For its size,
I know no town in France in which past and present have blended more
happily. Wherever you walk, in the heart of the town, the next corner
has something fascinating to show.</p>

<p>The building which first calls for attention is the Cathedral of St.
B&eacute;nigne. Of the early, circular, Romanesque church, which dated from
the eleventh century, and was probably imitated from the Holy Sepulchre,
nothing now remains but the crypt. The primitive, carved pillars are the
oldest of their kind in Burgundy, and mark the origin of an art of sculpture,
that, as we have already seen, was to go far. In this rude church was
buried St. B&eacute;nigne, the Christian martyr of the third century; here, too,
the pious Al&egrave;the, St. Bernard's mother, was laid, probably in the year 1110;
and here, many a time, Bernard himself came down from his father's castle
at Fontaine, to pray, in those early days when his spirit was torn between the
claims of cloister and the world. The cathedral, above ground, though
historically interesting, as the scene of the inaugural ceremonies of the great
Dukes, and the solemn merger of the duchy into the kingdom of France, is
not architecturally of first-rate interest. Gothic art was not always well
inspired in Burgundy during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries;
and St. B&eacute;nigne is no exception to the rule. The fa&ccedil;ade is very bold, for
a church of cathedral rank; the west window is weak and shallow, and the
parvis mean and uninteresting. Nor is the interior successful. The
triforium, one of the feeblest I know, is suggestive of a cardboard model, and
the simplicity of the nave has been broken by a series of restless yearning
statues, that, poised upon the abaci of the capitals, grimace at one another
across the nave. The thirteenth-century choir is better; though spoiled
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
architecturally by bare spaces of wall between the triforium and the sills of
the clerestory. The exterior, however, especially as seen from the east-end,
is impressive, and the "Snake-skin" tiling, though rather trying at first, is
rich and effective, when the eye has become accustomed to the shock.</p>

<p>Opposite to St. B&eacute;nigne is a typical Burgundian church of the twelfth
century, with a triple porch and narthex, an octagonal tower, and a beautiful
Romanesque south doorway. It is now a secular building, as are several
other old churches of Dijon. You may look, as I did, through a decorated
window of St. Etienne, and see a man changing his shirt!</p>

<p>Another church of considerable interest, from the architectural point of
view, is St. Michel. I am not referring to the interior, which is, on the
whole, an ineffective example of late Gothic, with clumsy vaulting ribs, and
heavy, square, nave piers, rounded off by vaulting shafts at the angles&mdash;but
to the fa&ccedil;ade, one of the best examples I know of Gothic design worked out
in Renaissance detail, with four classical orders superposed.<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Hugues
Sambin, the architect, or reputed architect&mdash;he who did those beautiful doors
for the Palace de Justice, that we have seen in the Mus&eacute;e&mdash;has made so
harmonious a compromise of the two styles, that I wonder he has not found
more imitators. The fact that others dared not follow emphasises the
difficulty of the task.</p>

<p>But the most interesting, by far, of all the churches of Dijon, is Notre
Dame, that, within hail of the Palace, and dedicated to Our Lady, enjoyed
the special patronage of the Dukes. It was here that, after the great
tournament at the arbre Charlemagne, in the plain south of Dijon, to be
spoken of presently, the competing knights came to hang up their shields,
and to render thanks to their preserver. Here, too, in 1453, after long
imprisonment in the east, came Philippe Pot, whom also we shall meet again,
barefooted, amidst a brilliant assemblage, to fulfil his vows to Notre Dame
de Bon Espoir.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Notre Dame is a purely Burgundian Gothic church, of the thirteenth
century. The interior, with its typical stiff leaf capitals, and pointed arches,
is not very remarkable. The arcade round the choir is good; but the square
blocks above the abaci, that take the vaulting shafts, are clumsy, and the
rose windows without tracery, in the transept, are not effective. As with
St. Michel, it is the exterior design that makes the church so remarkable
from an architectural point of view. The triple porch&mdash;if its carvings were
as good as those above&mdash;must have been very charming before the revolutionary
gentlemen set to work with hammer and axe upon tympanum and
arch.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Even now it is pleasing. Indeed, the west front, as seen from the
Rue des Forges, though, perhaps, a
little stiff, is most striking, especially
when the bright sun of Burgundy is
picking out in warm light and pitchy
shadow the triple row of strange eager
faces, that, craning their necks out
over the street, gaze down upon the
passers-by. These grotesque beasts,
and the friezes in which they dwell, are
among the best examples of Burgundian
sculpture to be seen anywhere. They
have all the vigour, individuality, and
vivacity that are characteristic of the
Province. The fa&ccedil;ade, as a whole,
with its double arcade, between the
friezes, surmounting the triple porch,
is one of the most original in France,
and would be much more effective than
it is, could it be better seen. The
tower, too, and the flanking turrets,
are boldly designed, and relieved with
little sculptures, grinning suns and
grimacing heads, on the corbels and
the springings, that suggest an art
lively and alert compared with the conventional dulness of St. B&eacute;nigne.
The sense of realism is increased by the many pigeons&mdash;not of stone&mdash;who
glide all day over monsters' backs, and coo into old monks' ears.</p>

</div>

<p>The Jacquemart clock on the tower was brought to Dijon by Philippe le
Hardi, after the sack of Courtrai, in 1383. Froissart, charmed with it,
declared it to be "ouvrage le plus beau qu'on put trouver de&ccedil;&agrave; ni del&agrave; la
mer." Philip may have thought so, too; since he chose it for his trophy.</p>

<p>Nearly every street in this central part of old Dijon, around the palace of
the Dukes, has many good things. Late Gothic buildings meet you at
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
every turn, and in no town of France that I know, except, perhaps, Toulouse,
will you find better Renaissance houses. The fronts of the Maison Milsand
and the Maison des Caryatides, are both charming of their kind; and so is
the courtyard of the Maison Richard, or Hotel des Ambassadeurs, with a
magnificent medi&aelig;val staircase,
and a fifteenth century gallery of
perpendicular woodwork. Behind
Notre Dame is the old Hotel
Vogu&eacute;, with one of the fine snake-skin
roofs that are a feature of
Dijon.</p>

</div>

<p>But of all the quiet haunts in
the city, the best are the little
garden without, and the courtyard
within, the Palace of the Dukes.
Looking up through green boughs
at the beautiful windows of the
Salle des Gardes and the Tour de la Terrasse, or, from a post upon the
inner flag-stones, peering into the dark shadows of the lovely Renaissance
staircase that mounts by the Tour de Bar,<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> you may go back again into the
days when Dijon was more famous, more alive, than mustard and gingerbread
can ever make it.</p>

<p>The mention of mustard and gingerbread, reminds me that here, opposite
to the staircase, is the kitchen, where, between eight great furnaces, two in
each wall, below a converging shaft, fashioned to carry the fumes upward to
the blue sky, the Duke's chef superintended a small army of perspiring cooks
and scullions.</p>

<p class="pmb1">My wife's brains were busy with such dreams, as she sat in that courtyard
sketching the well, the staircase, and little Marie Bon, who, for two sous,
and the privilege of being allowed to tell about her uncle, also a painter&mdash;he
worked on back doors&mdash;allowed herself to be drawn. And while the
picture grew, tiresome boys would come up and jostle each other, and make
remarks&mdash;usually, however, of a complimentary nature.</p>

<p class="p1">"Ma foi, c'est &eacute;patant, &ccedil;a!" "C'est tr&egrave;s chic&mdash;beaucoup mieux qu'une
photographie."</p>

<p>Gallant young men, too, would come, and say boldly, as though prepared
to step into the breach, "Madame, n'a pas de cavalier aujourdhui!" And
diffident old ladies, shy, but unable
to restrain their curiosity,
would come up and say, "Est-ce
qu'on est permis de regarder un
peu, Madame?" And my wife
would smile and reply, "Mais
oui, certainement." For towards
good and diffident old ladies her
heart is as soft as it is adamantine
towards small and cheeky urchins.</p>

<p>One other building in Dijon I
will mention&mdash;the Palais de Justice,
which has a beautiful Renaissance
fa&ccedil;ade, with a high gable in
the Flemish style, and a domed
Corinthian porch. The threatening darkness of the stone, and the grim,
lurid, purplish colours it takes in certain lights, harmonise well with our
memories of deeds done in that Salle des Pas Perdus, and the torture chamber
of the prisons within. This Palace was also the Parliament House of the
Valois Dukes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But we, who pass our days in London, soon weary of other cities, even
though they be ancient and French; besides, we wanted to see something of
the environs of Dijon; so a fine afternoon found us cycling along the five
kilometres of flat yet attractive road that leads by the Canal de Bourgogne
to Plombi&egrave;res, in the valley of the Ouche. There was music all the way;
the breeze that whispered to the "paint-brush" poplars, and rustled in the
reeds and grasses of the bank; the song of the grasshoppers, the "sound of
waters shaken" where they curled foaming through the lock gates. We
had beauty with us, too; all the mature beauty of a bright autumn day, as
we glided beside the still water, between waving grasses and lichen-gilded
trunks. On our left were golden vineyards, and, beneath them, rose-embowered
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
cottages and jagged quarries where brawny quarrymen were
dealing mighty, swinging strokes that echoed through the valley. To our
right were the terraced hills of Talant, and ahead the tower of Plombi&egrave;res
church, high above the village roofs. We passed white-hooded peasants&mdash;ample
women with genuine, solid bodies, ambling homeward from the markets
of Dijon, and black-bloused peasants, who, blessed with a patience that
was never given to us, were "soaking an indefinite bait in an indifferent
stream;" we passed blazing bonfires by the side of the road, whereon girls
were heaping all the grasses they had cut during a busy day with the sickle.
And when we got there, we found the mairie besieged by women in white
dresses and men in black coats. There was a wedding; and couples were
whirling in the Salle de Bal.</p>

<p>That Talant I spoke of, on the hill, is another spot to make for between
tea and dinner; if only for the views it gives you down over the City of
Dijon and the Valley of the Ouche. From the village green, shaded with
ancient walnut trees, between which the children play with their dappled
goats, there lie before you, across the willow-fringed silver streak that is
the Canal de Bourgogne, the hills of the C&ocirc;te d'Or, now shrouded in the
purple mists of evening. Southward, looming through the red smoke-wreaths,
that curl upwards from its factories, rise the towered palace, and the
spires of the ducal city. Below, among the vines and fruit trees, beside the
red gravel pit in the grey cemetery, the flames of the peasants' fires, flashing in
lines, like the camp fires of a beleaguered town, are deepening with an
opalesque veil of floating vapour the gathering mysteries of the night.</p>

<p>As we climbed the road that winds up the hill to Talant, whose old
Castle, by the way, was the scene of a hundred memorable events, that I
have no time to remember now, we saw on our right another wooded spur
of the C&ocirc;te d'Or, crowned with a big church and a little one. We knew
it at once for Fontaine, the home of St. Bernard&mdash;a spot not to be missed.
The next day found us there. Passing through the village, we came to a
small, round pool at the foot of the steep, shaded with a ring of poplars and
walnut trees. This must be the very pool in which St. Bernard plunged,
when, in the hey-day of youth, he felt his blood glowing too warmly within
him. I wonder that the peasants, or the priests, have not made holy water
of it before this. We climbed the hill, and, sitting on a broken stone wall,
caught glimpses, across the changing vines, of distant Dijon towers, while
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
those improvident grasshoppers, who should have been harvesting against a
coming winter, just sang and sang, as though they would out-sing the larks.</p>

<p>Then I wandered through the little Burgundian church, and the tangled
wilderness of a churchyard, while my wife, sitting enthroned in lilac bushes,
and eating blackberries of her own picking, watched the western sun gilding,
height beyond height, the distant hills, and dreamed of Bernard, her chosen
patron saint. How often must he, torn between chivalry and church, have
wrestled with his spirit upon that very spot.</p>

<p>This great building near us, on the crest of the hill, is built on the site
of Tescelin le Roux's castle; and contains, I believe, some remnants of it;
but it has no longer any attraction for us. Restoration and modern additions<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
have stolen away its hoary age. We may be foolish in these matters;
but we got more pleasure from a wooden bust of St. Bernard, that we bought
for three francs from a white-winged sister, in the pilgrimage shop beside
the basilica. We still look at it daily, and believe it&mdash;quite wrongly, no
doubt&mdash;to be a perfect likeness of Tescelin's perfect son.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before we part from Dijon, there is one other episode in its history to
which I should like to refer.</p>

<p>Leaving the town by the southward road that leads to the ancient village
of Rouvres&mdash;Philippe le Hardi, by the way, before his accession to the dukedom,
was Philippe de Rouvres&mdash;you come upon a vast plain traversed by many
poplar-fringed roads.</p>

<p>It was in this plain, close to Dijon, towards Nuits, that was held, in July,
1443, the great tournament known as the Tournoi de l'Arbre Charlemagne,
given by the Seigneur de Charny and twelve other noblemen of Burgundy.
Two lists were dressed&mdash;the smaller one for combats on foot, and the other,
much larger, for mounted knights with the lance. Between them was a
great pavilion of wood. The larger list had two steps at one end, to enable
attendants to assist, to arm, or to disarm their knight, without compelling
him to dismount. On the Dijon side of the lists was a great tent, for use as
occasion might require. The tree of Charlemagne, close by, was draped
with cloth of high warp, bearing the arms of the Lord of Charny; near it
was "a fountain large and fair with a high stone capital above which were
images of God, of Our Lady, and of Madame St. Anne, and upon the said
capital were raised in stone the thirteen blazons of the arms of the said Lord
of Charny and of his companions."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_218.jpg" width="320" height="516" alt="Dijon; a fifteenth century Window" title="" />
</div>

<p>On that 11th July,
"the princes having
come they entered the
house set apart for this
purpose (which was
right honourably decked
and hung); and the Duke
of Burgundy held a little
white baton in his hand
to throw and separate the
champions, their arms
being concluded, as is
the custom in such a
case. As for the lists,
they were a sight most
triumphant to see; for
they were decked with
two pavillons for the
knights, bearing their
arms and devices in
blazons, banners, and
otherwise ... the
entry of the assailant
in the lists was on the
side of Dijon, and that
of the defender and
guardian of the pas was
on the side of Nuits."</p>

<p>The first fight between
Charny and a
Spanish knight, both on foot and armed with axes, is too like that already
described, in the Tournoi de la dame de Pleurs, to justify us in giving Olivier
de la Marche's graphic description of it. We will tell, instead, of a fight on
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the 9th day of the Tournament, between the Count of St. Martin and
Guillaume de Vaudrey.</p>

<p>"At the third course the said De Vaudrey reached the Count's great arm-guard
and disarmed him, so that they had to forge and open the said arm-guard,
and two full hours were spent before he was re-armed. At the fourth
charge the said Guillaume de Vaudrey reached the Count, with his lance on
the arm near the side, and with this stroke he dinted his arm, and broke his
lance off short at the blade, so that the blade remained in the said Count's
arm, and readily appeared the blood and the wound. So the Duke commanded
that he should at once be disarmed, and set aright, and certes the
duke and all the lords were most troubled at this adventure; and even the
said De Vaudrey regretted right wonderfully his companion's wound."</p>

<p>There was much subsequent discussion as to how this accident could have
occurred; and the general opinion seemed to be that it was the Count's own
fault, by reason of a bad trick he had of riding at his man from the corner
of the lists, and so meeting him cross-wise, instead of charging along the
matting&mdash;which was laid from end to end of the lists especially for that
purpose; but, whatever the cause, as Olivier fatalistically remarks, "Ce qui
doit advenir advient: et fut telle ceste aventure."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 170px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_219.jpg" width="170" height="170" alt="Ornament" title="" />
</div>

<p>"On the 10th day of August, a day of St. Laurence, came Monsieur de
Bourgogne, Madame his spouse, all the ladies and lords, to see the arms of
the two noblemen, and there presented
himself Jacques de Challant Signeur de
Manille, most honourably accompanied
by the Lord of Charny, and by his companions,
as also by his relatives and
friends; and he presented himself on a
charger, covered with cloth of blue
damask, right prettily adorned with his
letters and devices; as he was mounted
and armed ready to furnish arms. On
the other side presented himself the
knight (who sustained the enterprise),
mounted and armed as is fitting in such case. His horse was decked, as I
remember, in satin, half white and half violet, quartered; and right well
the knight sat on his horse, for in figure he was supple, fair to look upon, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
right agreeable to all. All due things were done and the lances distributed;
and it came about that in the first onset Jacques de Challant got home upon
the knight's arm-guard; by the which he was disarmed, so that the said arm-guard
had to be opened by the armourers, (and it took) more than three
hours, and while they made good the said arm-guard, the Lord of Charny
caused a banquet to be served to the Duke and to the Duchess and to all
the Signeurs, where they were sitting, right bounteously, both meats and
wines."</p>

<p>After the luncheon they set to it again.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"And at their second charge the noble men rode with all the strength of
their steeds; and so stern was this onset, that the Spaniard's charger could not
sustain the shock, so fell to the ground; and swiftly horseman and horse were
raised, but from this fall the Spaniard's harness was so bent and forced that
he was quite disarmed; and they must needs put off those arms unto another
day. Within a few days after that the term of six weeks that this noble
meeting should last was past and expired, and the following day (which was
on a Sunday, a little before the Great Mass) the kings-at-arms and the
heralds assembled from all parts further to honour the mystery; and, having
put on their coats of arms, they brought by order and with great magnificence,
the two shields which for six weeks had been hung and fastened to the tree
of Charlemagne, and on which was founded the meeting aforesaid. Then
they entered the Church of Notre Dame de Dijon, and all kneeling offered
and presented the aforesaid shields to the glorious Virgin Mary; which shields
are still in the said church, in a chapel on the right hand as you come to
the choir."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>


<p class="p2">By a curious coincidence&mdash;by a real coincidence, reader, not by design&mdash;it
was on a morning of Easter-day that we rode out from Dijon to Lux&mdash;on
just such an Easter morning as that about which I am going to tell; the air
fresh and fragrant, the larks in full song, and the sun shining so strongly in
the deep, blue sky, that I had to make a Sunday purchase of a broad-brimmed
straw hat. So that, you see, in one sense, I began the day badly, and perhaps
deserved the trouble that befell me later.</p>

<p>Lux, the village in which the legend begins, and the village beyond it,
are not particularly interesting places, situate on the border of the For&ecirc;t de
Velours, some twenty or more kilometres north-east of Dijon, in Wiltshire-like
scenery reminding one of Salisbury Plain. If you want a not too
exciting excursion, to fill an otherwise idle day, by all means go there; but
truth compels me to add that this Creux du Diable, when you have found
it<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>&mdash;and it is not particularly easy to find, being hidden one hundred yards
within the wood&mdash;is not exciting. It is just a tangled pit running sheer
down from the scrub that borders the forest path. One look at it was
enough. We felt no desire to follow the devil down into its depths, nor
did conscience tell us that we deserved to. True, we, too, had hunted on
Easter morning, without going to Mass; but then we had hunted a legend,
not a boar&mdash;and surely that makes all the difference.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Back to the village, then, we went; and there I re-discovered a peasant, of
whom I had asked the way. He was sitting in a lovely doorway, at the top
of some broken steps, reading a paper. Hearing the whirr of the wheels, he
looked up.</p>

<p>"Ah ha! did you find it?" "Thanks to you," said I, and joined him on
the steps.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu," says he, "It's a strange place. It ends almost in a point&mdash;this
Creux du Diable. It is just full of foxes' holes; and as for the vipers&mdash;there
are so many there that, when the time comes to cut the wood, they have
to do it in the fraiche; sans cela ils vous mordent les jambes &agrave; tout instant.
O! il y en a; il y en a!</p>

<p>"Why do they bite less in the fraiche&mdash;these limbs of Satan?" I asked
him.</p>

<p>"Oh! they are busy in the morning (font leur travail le matin)."</p>

<p>I tried to get the old man's version of the legend; but, discovering that he
knew nothing of it, I bid him farewell.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said he, shaking my hand warmly, "When we meet at
Dijon, nous irons boire un coup."</p>

<p>So we rode home through a hop country&mdash;a land of blackthorn and good
purple furrows, dotted with stacks of poles. Will you listen, while we go,
to the legend of that viper-haunted pit?</p>


<div class="block0">

<p class="p2 center font11 pmb1">THE DEVIL'S PIT</p>

<p>It is Easter day. From the belfry the Alleluia rings out; the lark sings it
above the meadows; the thrush whistles it in the woods; the sun writes it in
letters of gold on the blue, blue sky. All nature is in her gayest mood, to
celebrate the festival of Christ's resurrection.</p>

<p>In the village of Lux, all hearts are echoing this Alleluia. The good
people, in their holiday attire, go to hear matins, and to receive communion
with holy Jesus, the renewer of heavenly as of earthly spring. But to Gaston,
the lord of the village, the pure joys of the Christian Easter are unknown.
He is a young baron, proud, haughty, violent, and devoted only to the chase.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Loudly he sounds the horn, and cries to his servants: "Saddle the horses,
and bring hither my hounds."</p>

<p>Vainly the grooms and valets recall to him the solemnity of the day, and
our Lord's commandment. "To the hunt," he cries; "We leave prayers to
the priests and the women; such a fine hunting day is not to be missed."</p>

<p>The steeds are ready; in the courtyard of the castle the hounds are baying.
As Gaston gives the signal for departure, the old chaplain lays his hand on
the courser's rein.</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, Monseigneur!" cries he, "do not thus outrage
God, nor so darkly stain your soul!"</p>

<p>The headstrong baron strikes the priest, who, without flinching, offers
again his old white head to the blow.</p>

<p>"Strike again, Monseigneur; but, for pity of your soul, do not fail to hear
mass to-day; else, evil will befall you."</p>

<p>Again he is repulsed, and the young lord departs.</p>

<p>Followed by his hounds and his servants, and blowing great blasts upon
his horn, Gaston passes through a straggling village. Disdainfully he looks
down on the good villagers, who salute him on their way to church. "Misfortune
will come upon our lord," murmur the old men. "Great and
powerful seigneur though he be, he insults and scorns a greater and more
powerful than himself."</p>

<p>Two wide roads meet upon the verge of the forest of Velours. There
come two horsemen, riding swiftly as the wind, and place themselves each
by Gaston's side. He on the right, mounted on a white horse, is radiant
and of noble mien; his eyes shine with a heavenly light, and his clothing,
glistening like snow, exhales a perfume sweeter than the meadows on a morning
of Spring. The rider on the left is of sullen countenance, and swarthy
of aspect; his glance stern and forbidding. His hair is blacker than the
raven's wing; and his garments, darker than the night, emit an odour of
sulphur. His steed glows like a flame of fire.</p>

<p>"Friends," cries Gaston, "Welcome to you both. In happy hour you
have come, to hunt the great woods with me. Fair fall us then! there is
no sport, in heaven or on earth, like the chase&mdash;above all when we hunt in
goodly company."</p>

<p>The horseman on the right speaks: "Young seigneur, the bell calls you;
listen to its plaintive note chiming, from far away, through the trees. Return;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
or misfortune will befall you. Let us kneel together at the altar of
Christ. Already, before daybreak, I heard mass, and sang the Alleluia;
willingly will I do so again by your side. Come! Our duty done, sweeter
by far will be the pleasures of the chase."</p>

<p>"Ride, noble baron, ride," cries the black horseman. "Do not listen to
this ill counsellor. The bugle blast is finer music than the chiming of bells,
and the hunt better pastime far than a dull priest's sermon, and the droning
of hymns."</p>

<p>"Well said, friend on my left!" cries Gaston. "Without offence to the
white horseman, you are jovial company, after my own heart. We young
lords want lively sport and merry jests; let us leave sermons and paternosters
to the monks."</p>

<p>Gaston has unleashed his hounds. Caressing them with eye and hand,
urging them on with voice and gesture, he looses them upon the scent.
With heads held low and wagging tails, baying with deep bell notes, they
dash through the forest upon the track of the game. The baying redoubles,
as, plunging into a thick copse, they come upon the lair of a great wolf.
With bristling hair, fiery eyed, and snarling horribly, for an instant the fierce
brute faces the hounds, then turns, and flies through the forest. Vainly he
seeks the thickest brakes, the most secret hollows; always the ravening pack
is at his heels.</p>

<p>At length the wolf gains the open country, and the chase follows him:
the blast of Gaston's horn has collected the scattered huntsmen. Far, far
they gallop, by cornfields and meadows, over weald and waste.</p>

<p>From a hamlet before them, comes tripping a little shepherdess at the
head of her flock. The road is narrow and bordered by hedges. All in
tears, the child cries out to Gaston: "Be merciful, sweet lord, be merciful;
spare my flock. For pity's sake, do not destroy the widow's sheep, and our
dear little lambs."</p>

<p>"Have pity, for your soul's sake," cries the white horseman. "Do not
scorn her prayers nor her tears; they will rise to God, and cry out for
vengeance against you there."</p>

<p class="pmb1">"Ride down lambs and sheep," replies the black rider. "What are they&mdash;that
they should spoil a young lord's sport? For such a trifle must we let
our prey escape us?"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_225.jpg" width="421" height="618" alt="Through the Forest" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"You are right," cries the impetuous hunter. He spurs on his horse;
after him gallop the grooms and the valets. Only the white horseman turns
aside with a sigh.</p>

<p>Like a whirlwind the hunt has passed, leaving desolation and death in its
wake. The sheep fall bleeding to the earth, the lambs are trampled down,
and the little shepherdess is lying upon the ground, bruised like a trodden
flower of the field.</p>

<p>Still the wolf flies on&mdash;by field and wood, by hill and valley, by upland
and mountain. None can overtake him. The hounds fall exhausted;
scarce a horse can carry its rider further.</p>

<p>The hunters come to a lonely valley. There, near a spring which bubbles
beneath an ancient oak, a little chapel and a cottage rise from the midst of
a field of green corn. This is the little domain of an old hermit, whose days
are passed in work and in prayer; one who shelters the poor, and puts the
lost traveller upon his way.</p>

<p>"Noble baron," cries the black horseman, "By my troth, here let us
stay, and refresh ourselves. There is water for our thirst, and good grazing
for our steeds." "Zounds," replies the hunter, "You say well."</p>

<p>Gaston, with a blast of his horn, recalls the hounds and attendants; and,
despite the entreaties of the white horseman, and the reluctance of his followers,
he bids them turn the horses into the field of green corn. Hastening
to him, the hermit cries, in tones of earnest pleading: "Have pity, gracious
lord; spare the labour of an old man; do not let your steeds devour and
trample down the field which nourishes the solitary, the traveller, and the
poor."</p>

<p>"To the devil with hermits and nuns," replies the proud hunter. "Away
with you, lazy rascal; or your carcass shall go to feed my hounds."</p>

<p>Frightened and sad, the poor old man turns away, murmuring to himself:
"Father, which art in Heaven, forgive this young man; Thy providence
which feeds the birds of the air and clothes the flower of the field will suffice
for me also."</p>

<p>"Gaston," interposes the white rider, "Your words are harsh. Who
knows but that you owe your very life to this old man? that, perchance without
his prayers and fastings, your soul, already weighed many times in the
heavenly scales, might well have been found too light." But the admonition
of the white horseman passes unheeded. Seated beside the spring, the
huntsmen make a long and merry repast; the jests ring out, loose and loud;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
with wild laughter the young baron applauds every sally of his dark companion.</p>

<p>'Tis the vesper hour; the hermit rings the chapel bell. To-day he is not
alone in the sanctuary; the white horseman, leaving his companions, joins
the old man in psalm and canticle. Never has the recluse heard a voice more
pure, never has he joined in a more holy communion. The two servants of
God, leaving the chapel together, pause for a moment on the threshold.
They gaze out over the scene. The huntsmen are gone; the field of green
corn is ravaged, blasted, as though by a storm of hail. In one hour, Gaston's
horses have destroyed the work of a year.</p>

<p>The white horseman bids farewell to the hermit, and hastens to join the
baron. Regretfully the recluse watches the departing figure. "Who," he
murmurs to himself, "may this noble hunter be? His kiss has filled me
with peace and joy, and all my heart is aglow in his presence."</p>

<p>Now the hunt is again set on. The wolf has doubled back upon his
track. Meanwhile the forest shadows lengthen, the sun is low upon the
horizon. Once more the hunt passes through the village. In the road, still
red with the blood of the shepherdess, a poor man stands, awaiting Gaston.
He seizes the young lord's cloak, and asks alms, for the love of God.</p>

<p>"Dear baron," cries the white rider, "It is a means of grace, which the
Saviour sends you. I beseech you, redeem your sins by the giving of alms;
it is like water which quenches fire. Give a helping hand to him who
stands for Jesus."</p>

<p>"Gaston," retorts the black rider, "For this clown will you stay the hunt,
and let the great wolf win the day? Gallop! gallop!"</p>

<p>"There are my alms," cries the brutal lord; and, making his horse rear,
with his whip he strikes at the poor man's head. The beggar utters a cry,
and wipes his bleeding face. Again the hunt plunges into the forest of
Velours, in pursuit of the tireless wolf. The sun has set behind the great
trees; the forest shadows are blotted out in the darkness of the night. 'Tis
the hour of solemn thought.</p>

<p>"Friend," says the white horseman, softly to Gaston, "this has been an
ill day's work: you have mocked God, you have insulted his minister; you
have trampled upon the shepherdess and her flock; you have ravaged the
hermit's field, and you have struck the face of the poor. Turn, I entreat
you, a suppliant eye to heaven, breathe a word of repentance towards God."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that to me?" replies the hunter with a sneer. "Time enough
yet to think of my soul. When I can search the woods no more, then I will
wear a hair shirt, throw largesse to monk and beggar, and mutter psalms and
what-not in church; but, until then, the gay life for me!"</p>

<p>"Gaston! the life of man is short and fragile; it is given him, not to waste
in folly; but to purchase therewith the joys of heaven. I conjure you, for
your soul's sake, implore the mercy of God."</p>

<p>"He's dull company indeed! Off with you to your paradise!" cries the
young lord, irritated by these entreaties, and by his day of ill-success.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Gaston," murmurs the white rider. "Why would you not
listen to one who would save you?" A tear falls from his eye, as spreading
wide two white wings, he soars heavenward, leaving behind him a stream of
light.</p>

<p>Then the hunter realizes that his good angel has deserted him. Fearfully
he looks towards the dark figure on his left; a shiver of mortal dread shakes
every limb, and the sweat of death rises damp upon his face. The arms of
the black one extend and seize him. He feels his flesh pierced and torn by
talons more powerful than a lion's, sharper than those of a vulture. He
roars with pain and terror; so bewildered is he, that no cry to God comes
from him, nor, with the holy sign, does he invoke the name of Jesus.</p>

<p>Still grasping his prey, the black horseman strikes the ground with his
lance. The earth groans deeply, opens wide, and from the gaping cavity
there rises a column of black smoke. From the abyss beneath, a sea of fire,
upon whose heaving waves are rolled the legions of the damned, rise lamentations,
cries, and blasphemies, heard above the roaring of the infernal waters.
Like fiery serpents the flames writhe and coil round the body of the guilty
hunter. "Gaston," hisses the black horseman, as steed and rider leap into
the boiling cavity; "Gaston, you have lent ear to me during life; now you
are mine for all eternity."</p>

<p>"Woe betide me!" cries the reprobate. "I have disregarded the Lord's
warning, and the counsels of my good angel!"</p>

<p>The abyss closed up, leaving only a dark and fearsome cavity. That
cavity is the Devil's Pit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We had started on our way back to Dijon by train, when, at Gemeaux,
the first stopping place, I became unpleasantly aware that I had left my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
notebook behind me, on the table of a caf&eacute; at Is-sur-Tille. Not caring to
leave several chapters of this volume to the vagaries of a very uncertain
memory, there was nothing for it but to leave the train, and walk the five
kilometres back to Is. Under less anxious circumstances I should have
enjoyed that walk, by field paths, below hills that reminded me of the North
Downs at Wrotham. The light was golden; the evening breeze rustled in
the young crops. In front of me paced a shepherd, followed by a flock of
pattering sheep, at whose fleeces the guardian dog tugged mercilessly, when
succulent, wayside trifles tempted them from the straight path.</p>

<p>On the bridge at Is, I met mademoiselle of the caf&eacute;, whose beaming
countenance revealed to me, before she spoke, the news that she had found
my book. So far so good; but how to pass the four hours before the next
train? I was cold and clammy; and much too tired to explore that savage
&eacute;tang de Marcilly hard by&mdash;lonely and desolate enough for the site of a
Cistercian house. Such places need a receptive mood. Moreover, here was
no fit place to dine&mdash;and I had within me a <i>Creux du Diable</i>. Surely my
good angel had left me.</p>

<p>I dined at last&mdash;very badly&mdash;and there were still two hours to wait. Time
flew no longer; it crept. Thoughts came no longer; nothing came; nothing
happened. I was bored, bored stiff. Reader, do you know what it is to be
bored?</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness you wouldn't be so garrulous&mdash;all about nothing."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Reader; but what the dickens is a fellow to do,
cast away for four mortal hours in this benighted hole&mdash;except talk?"</p>

<p>"Well its your own fault. You ought to have known, when you started,
that it was Easter morning, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! G r r r r r r r!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, it is time you left. If you miss this train you will be here all
night!"</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Et bien; au revoir, Mademoiselle."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Ever since we left Beaune, my wife has been endeavouring, at frequent
intervals, to extract from me an unconditional promise that, one day, we
will go to live there. "It would be lovely," she says, "to live close to the
H&ocirc;tel Dieu, and to watch the vines, for a whole summer, ripening on the
C&ocirc;te d'Or." So it would.</p>

<p>Certainly, if we are to live in France, we might do worse than choose
this little rampart-girdled town, that, though on the main line of the P.L.M.,
has retained so much of its medi&aelig;val charm, and still has houses to show
you of every century from the thirteenth onwards.</p>

<p>Beaune has a <i>cachet</i>, and surprises all its own. Go where you may, you
will find them, or they will find you. Stand in the little Rue de l'Enfer,
not happily named, and look up towards the church. Along a white wall,
that the sun has fretted with a lace-work of leafy shadow, runs a frieze of
ivy, below a rich cornice of blossoming lilac. Within that garden are
glimpses of ancient mottled walls, seen through green branches, whose wavy
lines lead up to the tower, crowned by the lovely dome and lantern of Notre
Dame.</p>

<p>Or stand beneath the exquisite, gothic porch of that same church, and
look through its soft, brown shadowy arches to the white walls and flowery
gardens of the old houses beside it; or across the place, to where the warm,
purple shadows lie upon the rosy oriel and tourelle of the Maison du
Colombier.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_231.jpg" width="345" height="660" alt="Beaune; Belfry of the Hospice de la Charit&eacute;" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>There are good things, too, in the centre of the town&mdash;the Flemish belfry
in the Place Monge; ancient houses in the Rue de Lorraine; and especially
a glimpse of a fifteenth century, pink-washed corner shop, topped by the
graceful lantern of the Hospice de la Charit&eacute;.</p>

<p>Here we are back at Notre Dame, one of the finest churches in Burgundy,
but so hemmed in by other buildings that it is not seen to advantage,
except from the west side, at a point in the street beyond the Colombier.
There only do you get the whole building and the proportions of the tower
in good perspective. The view from the east end, however, is presentable.
The apsidal chapels, the ambulatory and lofty choir, leading the eye upward,
stage by stage, to the glorious dome tiled in red, green, and yellow, give a
quite Burgundian effect of satisfying solidity, and of colouring that, though,
on the whole, rather cold, is harmonious in certain lights.</p>

<p>As usual, the heavy flying buttresses, that fail to fly, are an architectural
defect.</p>

<p>The gem of the exterior is the early thirteenth-century, triple, open-aisled
porch, of two bays, with gloriously carved panelled doors of the
fifteenth century. For grace and harmony of proportion this porch is one of
the best in France. It recalls that most successful of all fa&ccedil;ades, Peterborough
Cathedral.</p>

<p>The interior has all the features of twelfth-century Burgundian romanesque&mdash;an
almost barrel-vaulted nave, and aisle, with slightly stilted horseshoe
arches, and quadripartite vaulting, groined, without ribs. Some of the
cushion capitals are plain, some carved, and the vaulting shafts throughout,
except in the transept, take the ordinary Burgundian form of fluted
pilasters.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Each bay of the triforium is divided, as usual, into three round-headed
arches&mdash;of which two are blind and the centre one pierced&mdash;with fluted, or
zig-zagged pilasters between them. In the chapel of St. L&eacute;ger are two quite
interesting fifteenth century frescoes of the raising of Lazarus, and the stoning
of Stephen&mdash;both, probably, by a painter of the Flemish school. The
former picture, though mutilated and faded, is still quite realistic; too much
so, in a sense; for the bystanders are so interested in the miracle that they
have elbowed the Christ quite to one side of the picture. Martha is prominent,
in the conventional attitude, with her handkerchief to her nose. "Jam
Foetet."</p>

<p class="p1">But Notre Dame, though good, is not the best of Beaune. The church
must yield to the H&ocirc;tel Dieu. History, or, at any rate, my history, does not
relate how Nicholas Rolin, the Chancellor of Philippe le Bon, came to erect
at a little fifth-rate town, such as is Beaune, a hospital unrivalled in all
France; yet such is the fact. I do not even know why he built one at all,
unless old Louis XI.'s mot be true&mdash;that he had "made enough poor to necessitate
building a hospital to keep them in." But, there it is, an eighth
wonder of the world; beautiful, from the crest on the gable to the knocker
on the door.</p>

<p>This H&ocirc;tel Dieu, seen on a grey day or a blue one, is absolutely harmonious
and satisfying. Whether you follow the length of soft, yellow,
brown wall, the blue-grey expanse of the high-pitched roof, the delicate
fl&ecirc;che, or the starry, gabled hood over the entrance, your eye feasts upon a
poem in form and colour; you feel at once the intense delight of looking
upon a work of art that could not have been better done. But you will stay
longest before the porch, the most daring and most completely successful
that exists.</p>

<p>The entrance is beneath a flattened arch, through a panelled door with a
beautiful forged-iron knocker and alms-box; all protected by a glorious three-gabled
hood, crocketed and pinnacled, and built into the main wall, from
which it projects without visible support. The pendants have angels, bearing
shields, with the arms of Nicholas Rolin and his wife. The hood is
slated in grey, as is the roof, and the blue vault beneath is starred with golden
stars, symbolizing the little heaven within. Upon the blue tympanum is
written in gold letters, "Hostel Dieu, 1443." All these blues and golds
harmonise perfectly with the great crested roof, whether in its more sombre,
grey mood, or when the richer purples come leaping from it at the call of
the sun, to play about the sides of the dormers, or among the shadows of the
flagged pinnacles above.</p>

<p>The exterior remains almost unchanged from the time of Nicholas Rolin,
when the poor of Beaune first gathered round the stone benches, and beneath
the verandah,<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> to receive their dole of five hundred kilos of bread that are still
distributed once a year to the needy of the district.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Following a white-winged sister, we passed into the courtyard, to find
ourselves in a great, galleried building, of the late Flemish type, with a many-coloured
linoleum roof, elaborate pinnacled gables, and, in one corner, a well
in the forged ironwork which the Flamands of that time worked with
unrivalled skill.</p>

<p>There was only one jarring note&mdash;the garish brown colour of the woodwork,
laid on, the guide told me, five years ago. It is a thousand pities; for
had the oak been merely oiled, or painted a dark brown, or matched with
one of the tints in the roof, many visitors would be spared a shock, and I
doubt not that the convalescence of certain patients would be considerably
accelerated. Yet, in spite of garish paint, we can echo Viollet-le-Duc's
sentiment, that it is worth while to be ill at Beaune.</p>

<p>This abode of peace takes you straight back to the fifteenth century, with
its beauties all intact, and only its horrors mitigated. Nothing here has
changed&mdash;from the costumes of the white angels who flit noiselessly through
the kitchens and wards, to the tapestry covers laid upon the curtained, oak
beds, with the oak chairs beside them. Even the pewter vessels are identical
with those in use at the founding of the hospital.</p>

<p>The chapel, too, opening from one of the wards, is a good place to pray
in. Through the glorious windows&mdash;copies of the original, resplendent with
figures and devices&mdash;the warm colour streams down upon the altar, where of
old was set up Roger Van der Weyden's magnificent Last Judgment; now
in the mus&eacute;e above. On great days the volets were drawn back, and the
picture exposed; magnificent red tapestries were laid upon the beds, and all
was ordered for the best in this little kingdom-of-heaven upon earth.</p>

<p>Here Guigonne de Salins, the great Chancellor's wife, is laid; and her
arms (the castle) and his (the key) with his device, "Seule <img src="images/6-pointed-star.jpg" width="12" height="14" alt="six-pointed star" title="" />" (Only
Star), are scattered broadcast. No less ubiquitous is her motto, The Bird on
the Bough, signifying how lonely she was to be after her lord's death. Guigonne,
no doubt, was sincere enough; but one cannot help remembering that
the sentiments expressed in these devices were not always lived up to. Did
not Rolin's own master, Philippe le Bon, for example, choose the words
"Aultre n'Auray" as a chaste allusion to his conjugal devotion? yet we have
Olivier de la Marche assuring us that his gracious master had "de b&acirc;tards et
de b&acirc;tardes une moult belle compagnie."</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>But I am digressing. We must follow to the mus&eacute;e our guide, whose
manner could not be more gentle, were we patients and not visitors,&mdash;reminded
on the way, by the sight of polished floors and shining pots, that
the cleanliness of this building moved a certain worthy Canon Papillon, in
the 17th century, to remark, "Ineptiarum stultus est labor," which, freely
rendered, means: "They are fools who waste soap."</p>

<p class="pmb3">The best thing in the mus&eacute;e&mdash;in fact, the only thing that one really goes
there to see&mdash;is the Last Judgment of Roger Van der Weyden, which, in
spite of the 19th century restoration, remains a splendid example of Flemish
art, still very Gothic in treatment, and full of the sadness of decline. The
work is executed with all the microscopic accuracy of detail characteristic of
the school. There is fine realism, and individual treatment; but no breakaway
from tradition: all the figures are consciously attitudinizing,
and one feels that the painter is making a last desperate effort
to enforce belief in an outworn dogma. The welter of human
beings, bursting out from their graves, dragging one another, and
being dragged, by hair and limbs, pell-mell down into hell;
this biting of fingers, and pulling of ears till they bleed, does not
convince. Such a subject was well suited to the primitives of the Romanesque
and early Gothic periods, but seems hopelessly archaic for a painter
born within hail of the Renaissance. Nevertheless, though, in spite of its
horrors, and its unhappy colouring, the picture, as you linger before it, grows
on you, it is with a sigh of relief that you turn to its more successful part, the
portraits of the donors, magnificent in their energy and expression. Here
you have an opportunity to judge concerning the probability of Louis XI.'s
alleged slander upon Nicholas Rolin. Did he, or did he not, grind the faces
of the poor? My wife says unhesitatingly, "He did"; and, looking at
the significant scarlet angel above his head&mdash;suggestive of a red aura&mdash;I
decline to contradict a lady. His is, indeed, a disinheriting countenance.
But Guigonne, his seule &eacute;toile, is of a different stamp. Piety exudes from
her. As the guide somewhat bluntly put it, "She was as good as she was
ugly"&mdash;a speech which no lady, living or dead, would ever forgive.</p>

<p class="p2">Leaving my wife to run the gauntlet of the gamins of Beaune, while she
sketched the starry hood and the porch of Notre Dame, we fared forth on
our bicycles, towards the ancient village of Bouilland, fifteen kilometres
away, to which I received my first call when I happened upon the legend of
its Abbey.</p>

<p>Bouilland lies beyond Savigny, in the heart of the valley of the Bouxaise,
a tributary of the Sa&ocirc;ne, by a road so lonely that, between Savigny and our
destination we met only one individual&mdash;and he was sitting in a cart, so fast
asleep that, though we longed to do so, we had not the heart to wake him.</p>

<p>Saint Marguerite lies high up in a hollow of the rocky hills, on the edge
of the For&ecirc;t au Maitre&mdash;one of the most deserted spots in all Christendom.
What was once a glorious building, with a Romanesque nave and a lovely,
late thirteenth-century transept and apse, lightened with carved foliage,
capitals, and graceful, slender shafts, is now a roofless ruin. Wild fruit
trees grow in the transepts; the floor of the nave is paved with a litter of
mossy stones, beneath which the ivy and the brambles take root; cowslips and
purple violets jewel the apse with delights beyond the art of even Gothic
sculptors; through the roofless arches you look up at the whispering forest-pines.
Westward of the Abbey, beside the deserted adjunct buildings, is a
grassy terrace, stone-walled, shaded by blossoming fruit trees. From this
fresh, green garden you can look, beyond the darkness of the ancient gateway,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
into the flaming yellow of a field of "Mustard," the symbol of a
living world beyond. Sit beside me on the old stone wall, and hear the
legend of Saint Marguerite.</p>

<p>In days of yore, there lived in the Castle of Vergy, a maiden, beautiful
and pure as an angel; she was named Marguerite.</p>

<p>Many young suitors of noble birth desired her hand: one, in particular,
was more handsome than all the others; but his conversation was unchaste,
and treachery lurked in his glance and in his smile.</p>

<p>Marguerite would never listen to his profane addresses; she repulsed him,
saying: "Speak not to me of earthly love; to me, who have chosen, for all
eternity, Jesus, the most loving and tender of husbands."</p>

<p>At the name of Jesus, the face of the handsome youth grew pale; and he
turned away.</p>

<p>The holy maid, sometimes followed by one of her companions, went to
speak of God and of heavenly things, with an old hermit, who lived in the
depths of a neighbouring forest.</p>

<p>One evening, when she was returning from one of these visits, and, mounted
on her mule, was crossing the great wood, she perceived the page awaiting
her at a bend of the path. Swiftly she turned the animal, and, in her hasty
flight, left her veil hanging on the branches of a hawthorn bush.</p>

<p>Her steed moved swiftly; but swifter still follows the treacherous youth;
he is lighter than the wind; scarcely do the grasses bend beneath his feet.</p>

<p>But&mdash;crowning misfortune&mdash;the poor girl, instead of following the broad
valley way, as her companion has done, turns into a side path that is soon
barred by a great rampart of rocks.</p>

<p>All is over; she must fall a victim to her pursuer.... Already he
stretches out his arms to seize her. As his hands, quivering with passion,
touch the young girl, he breaks into a peal of infernal laughter that resounds
through the whole valley.</p>

<p>Then Marguerite remembers her betrothed in Heaven. She calls upon
Him for aid; she murmurs His name, and arms herself with His sign.</p>

<p>At the name of Jesus, spoken with that faith which removes mountains,
the rock opens before her, and the mule carries the Christian maid to safety.</p>

<p class="pmb1">But the false page, a demon in disguise, fell down into a fiery gulf that
opened suddenly beneath his feet. Afterwards, when the earth had closed
again over the spot, the peasants found, lying upon the wayside grass, a girdle
of white silk, the symbol of Marguerite's purity and innocence.</p>

<p class="p1">The maid of Vergy reined in her mule before a fountain, a few paces from
the parted rock. She dismounted, and, prostrating herself, she consecrated
to the Lord her virginity that had been so miraculously preserved.</p>

<p>In a later year, with the dowry left her by her father, she built, on this
spot, a monastery, to which she gave the name of Ste. Marguerite, her patron
saint, as a song of thanksgiving in praise of her Heavenly Spouse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Philippe Pot being a name to conjure with in Burgundy, we took the first
opportunity to make acquaintance with his eagle's nest, the Roche-Pot. The
road from Beaune skirts the C&ocirc;te d'Or, as far as Pommard, and climbs, between
the vineyards, into the hills. These vineyards, in which are produced
some of the choicest vines of the district, are surrounded each with a stone
wall and gateway, with the name of the <i>clos</i> written on it&mdash;"Clos des
Ch&ecirc;nes," "Clos des Antres," etc. As you rise, there opens out a lovely
view over the fruitful plain of Burgundy, a golden sea of vines. Below us,
ahead, the dark roofs and spires of Meursault rise from the trees, and beyond
them, shining in a blue mist, the widening southern hills of the C&ocirc;te d'Or.</p>

<p>About half a mile from Meursault, the road, turning due west, plunges
down into the valley of the Clous, between the hills, rock-clad at their
summits, vine-clad below. Thence the way undulates past Auxey-le-Grand
and Melin, until suddenly you sight, above the trees, the towers of Rochepot
perched upon its crag. Leaving my wife to sketch, I made my way up
through the dilapidated village, and soon found myself crossing the drawbridge
of a medi&aelig;val castle, glowing as brightly with gold and colour, and
with blazoned coats of arms, as on the day when it was first built. Here
were round towers, machicolated battlements, a pepper-pot roof, with not a
stone or tile of them disordered. I had expected a ruin&mdash;a lizards' playground;
yet here before my eyes was Philippe Pot's own legend, "TANT
L VAUT," as fresh as painter and gilder could make it.</p>

<p>"Whose is this castle?" I asked of the harmless, necessary guide, who by
now had put in an appearance, and was assuring some gaping visitors that
Philippe was called Pot because he always carried a pot about with him&mdash;a
paint pot, judging by the condition of his castle.</p>

<p class="pmb1">"This is M. Carnot's castle, Monsieur, the eldest son of the late President.
He has already spent millions in restoration, and he is about to convert into
a terrace the remains of the 11th century Ch&acirc;teau, up there." He pointed
to a fine, rounded-headed window, of two lights, high above us on the rock.
While we were being hurried round this fortress of all the centuries, I fell to
thinking of Philippe Pot, of his home, and his legend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Begun in the thirteenth century, by Alexandre de Bourgogne, Prince de
Mor&eacute;e, the castle was fortified in the early fifteenth by Ren&eacute; Pot,<a id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> whose
son Philippe<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> was the only man of them all to leave it a popular name.</p>

<p>In the middle of the fifteenth century, the Ottoman Sultan, Mahomet II.,
was threatening Constantinople, then in the hands of Constantine, Emperor
of Byzantium, who appealed to Pope Nicholas V. for help against the
Islamite invasion. To young Philippe Pot, nearly twenty-five years of age,
the bravest, most handsome, and most eloquent chevalier of his day, and a
poet withal&mdash;a crusade was as the candle to the moth. Never might
come such another opportunity to win his spurs away from home. So he
wrote to his fianc&eacute;e, the richest and loveliest heiress of all Burgundy, Jeanne,
daughter of Pierre de Baufremont, Comte de Charny, great chamberlain of
Philippe le Bon.</p>

<p>"Gentille Damoiselle, I am setting forth to Constantinople; I wish before
our bridal to render myself worthy of you and of your valiant father."
Before dawn, on an August morning, in the year 1452, he left Rochepot,
and rode to Notre Dame de Dijon, where he met four hundred other young
knights sworn to follow his lead. There they heard Mass before the altar
of the Virgin, and bespoke her blessing on their banner, that bore her picture,
and the device: "Notre Dame de Bon Espoir, soyez-nous en aide." Then
they rode eastward through the streets of Dijon. "Honneur aux preux!"
shouted the crowds; "Honneur aux chevaliers de Notre Dame!"<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p class="pmb1">We have no time to follow all the adventures of our chevalier in the land
of Islam&mdash;how with his own hand, he slew and slew, until the bravest of the
Saracens learned to fear the prowess of the "Chevalier de la Mort"; how, at
last, he was captured by the Turks, before Constantinople, imprisoned,
flogged, almost to death, because he would not become the Sultan's man, nor
bow to the name of the Prophet&mdash;how he consoled himself in prison by
writing verses to the Lady Virgin to whom he was vowed.</p>

<p>His prayer was answered. For, before long, the Sultan, wishing to make
an end of his prisoner, brought him one day into the arena, and caused to be
handed to him, for his only weapon, a light scimitar, that was but a toy compared
with the young chevalier's mighty sword, beneath whose deadly strokes
so many Turks had already fallen. Then was loosed upon him, thus armed,
a magnificent lion, that had already been the death of many prisoner knights.</p>

<p>"This is no combat," murmured the assembled thousands, one to another,
"'Tis an execution&mdash;already the old lion has slain his hundreds&mdash;and he has
eaten nothing these three days," Meanwhile the adversaries stood face to
face. With two great bounds the lion is upon his man; but, as he crouches
for the third spring, the hero makes a swift movement; the scimitar flashes,
falls upon the animal's front paws. Roaring with pain and fury, the beast
rolls upon his back, and licks the stumps of his wounded legs. Again, like
lightning, the scimitar plays. In a moment the lion's tongue is lying at the
feet of the Sultan. With a last effort the wounded beast rises, open-mouthed.
Philippe, seizing his opportunity, plunges the blade down the
ravening throat. The great lion falls dead. Loud rings the applause of the
crowd, as the hero, waving aloft his smoking weapon, cries, "Gloire &agrave; Notre
Dame. Tant elle vaut!"</p>

<p>The Sultan, who loved courage first and last, descended into the arena,
hung a rich chain about his prisoner's neck, and said: "Such valour deserves
freedom. Return to your lady, and to your home."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>So the victorious Philippe reached France again, and, in poor man's guise,
begging his bread by the way, came to Rochepot, on the day following the
F&ecirc;te des Tr&eacute;pass&eacute;s, the great Autumn festival that the Catholic church has
appointed in celebration of the dead. There he found the castle all hung
with black, and a great company mourning a living man's death. So he
made himself known, and sorrow changed into exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>On the 11th November, 1453, through the fresh warm air of a St.
Martin's summer, a brilliant cort&egrave;ge issues from the Ducal Palace at Dijon,
and turns towards the church of Notre Dame. At their head rides Philippe
le Bon, crowned with the crown of Burgundy, and wearing, about his neck
and breast, the collar of the Golden Fleece, and a purple mantle, lined with
ermine. He is leading by the arm a slim girl, veiled, and clothed in white.
Behind them follows a young chevalier, in shining armour, with a lion's skin
clasped upon his shoulder. 'Tis Philippe Pot; his feet still bleeding from
the stones of the pilgrim way. In one hand he carries a candle, the other
arm supports the Duchess of Burgundy, splendid in a robe of cloth of gold.
Beside them walk two heralds-at-arms, one bearing a scimitar, the other a
veiled picture. From balcony and window the people acclaim their passage:
"Noel! Noel!"</p>

<p>They enter Notre Dame&mdash;its walls splendid with tapestries of Arras&mdash;and
kneel in the chapel of Notre Dame de Bon-Espoir. Philippe lights his
candle, and places it upon the altar. The picture is uncovered, and hung
before the black virgin. It shows the knight, under his Lady's protection,
slaying the lion in the arena. Below are written the words&mdash;</p>

<p>Having accomplished his vow, the knight puts on his spurs. The Duke
of Burgundy approaches, embraces him, gives him the collar and mantle of
the Toison d'Or. The fianc&eacute;e is led forward. Lover and lady join hands,
and&mdash;the due ceremonies accomplished&mdash;Philippe and his bride leave the
church.</p>

<p>"Noel! Noel!" shout the people. "Honneur au chevalier de Notre

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On our way home from Rochepot, we halted for a rest at Auxey le Grand,
and dropped into an inn, where we found two workmen hobnobbing over a
bottle of red wine. One of them&mdash;the listener&mdash;was just an ordinary workman;
common, base, and popular, as Pistol would have said. His companion,
however, was a man of mark&mdash;a handsome, bronzed rascal, whose fiercely
curled moustache and Paderewski hair, well set off by enormously baggy
corduroys, a scarlet belt, and a blue shirt, suggested the merry bandit of an
Elizabethan drama. Our curiosity being aroused, we addressed the brigand,
who was not slow to reveal his identity. He was one Fran&ccedil;ois Paulin, a
vine-dresser, and no brigand, as he proved by the production of a greasy
document, stating that "The administrative council of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Vigneronne
of the arrondissement of Beaune certifies that Monsieur Paulin (Fran&ccedil;ois)
successfully passed the examinations of March 24th, 1889, and is skilled in
pruning (apte &agrave; greffer) the vine, and in teaching that operation." Vines
and vineyards naturally became our topic.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the brigand; "What a season we have had. Nothing but
rain and cold, cold and rain! It is just ruin for us poor workmen." He
drained his glass, and put it down, with a tense Gallic movement of the arm.
He failed, somehow, to convey the idea that he was ruined. Such are the
triumphs of personality.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the crop fail utterly hereabouts?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Utterly, Monsieur," said Mathilde Duhesme, the innkeeper's daughter,
as she brought us our coffee. "Not a bunch of grapes."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_247.jpg" width="200" height="230" alt="Taking his Ease" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mathilde was a perfectly charming French girl, of the type that you will
come upon, here and there, even in the
remotest part of that country. England
breeds few such women, in her station
of life. That easy, graceful manner, and
natural amiability and dignity are found
here&mdash;when they are found at all&mdash;only
among the educated or the high-born.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; mon Dieu, you have come
in the wrong year for the vines," said the
brigand, thumping the table. "You
should have chosen a good season. Then
lots of visitors come. They come in
carts, full of <i>belles anges</i> with gentlemen
standing behind in top-hats. And they all
take photographs. This very day we
ought to have been in full vendange."</p>

<p>His pride would have been solely hurt, had he guessed how little his
description allured us.</p>

<p>"Let's drink to a full vendange," said I. Mathilde ran off for another
bottle.</p>

<p>"What do you earn, you vignerons, in a good year?"</p>

<p>"Four francs, and a litre of wine, per man, per day. And it is worth it;
for we make good stuff here on the hillside, though this village of Auxey is
the end of it. Yes, good wines!"</p>

<p>"Tell me more about them," I said.</p>

<p>"The best wines of all are called Aligote, and the second-best&mdash;still very
good&mdash;are called Pinot. The boite ordinaire that grows away there in the
plain, is called Gamay. When the Gamay is not red enough, we put it
into some Otellot; that's as black as your hat, and colours the rest up
beautifully. Do you drink much wine in your country, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"No, only the rich drink wine in our country. The poor never taste it.
They drink mostly beer!"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sapristi!"</p>

<p>It was now our turn to be questioned. Mathilde, in particular, was very
much interested in my wife's appearance and clothes. Were we married?
Were we married in church? Why were we travelling? Were the
English peasantry poor, and were they provident?</p>

<p>"More poor than provident," we said.</p>

<p>"Ah! now; the French poor are provident. They kill one pig a year,
and lose not a hair of it. First comes the bacon; the fat is used for preparing
meat; the blood for pudding; the entrails for sausages. It lasts from winter
to winter&mdash;ah, Madame is making a picture!"</p>

<p>Madame was sketching the brigand.</p>

<p>"I shall put you into our book," said she. The brigand beamed approval.
Five minutes later my wife thoughtlessly gave him the sketch. He tried not
to look hurt&mdash;he was not, then, to go into the book, after all. Her woman's
readiness saved the situation.</p>

<p>"I never forget what I have once drawn," she said.</p>

<p>"Vous y serez quand m&ecirc;me." He was quite pacified.</p>

<p>Then we left the men over their wine, while Mathilde took us the round
of the church and village. She certainly was a charming person. I am not
so sure that we shall live at Beaune after all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lest we should entirely forget the Roman occupation that was so much
in our minds at Autun, we decided to make a pilgrimage to Cussy, a village
due west of Beaune, where the Romans have set up a column, in memory
of an event, or of a person, unknown. If a motor car be not available, you
can best get there by taking the steam tramway, between Beaune and Arnay-le-Duc,
as far as Lusigny; thence by bicycle, or as you will. The journey
is worth making, for the sake of the climb you get through the gorge of
Nantoux, and up the valley of Mavilly, where the train mounts, by a series
of steep zig-zags, into the heart of the C&ocirc;te d'Or. The view that opens out
is quite Swiss in quality and magnificence. You look from the summit of
a gigantic devil's cauldron, down rocky steeps, shaped like cathedral organ-pipes,
whose eerie mountain music cheers the vignerons at their work below.
All this great expanse of brown, cliff-bound upland, dappled in spring-time
with blossoming fruit trees, is curiously chequered by dark hedges and white
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
serpentine roads. Stage by stage the land falls away from you, until all
detail is lost, and far away, over range after range of shining hills, the boundless
plains of lower Burgundy merge imperceptibly into the sky.</p>

<p>So the train puffs up to the col, then rattles down into the quaint village
of Lusigny. The road to Cussy climbs the opposite hill for two kilometres
or so, before switchbacking through the village of Montceau to this lovely
spot that the Romans, or Gallo-Romans, have so chosen to honour.</p>

<p>Not a human being could we discover in all Cussy. Some destroying
angel, I thought, must have passed over, leaving only chickens alive, and, by
oversight, one old woman, of whose close-fitting, white cap we caught a
glimpse through an open window.</p>

<p>But my wife would not accept that solution.</p>

<p>"No; there has been no destroying angel here. There has just been a
most wicked old witch, who, in revenge for some insult, has changed all the
villagers into ducks and hens. Let's speak to them. I'm sure they'll
answer."</p>

<p>She addressed a lanky, yellow hen, that had left scratching, to watch us.
Poised on one leg it stood, with its head bent inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Please, Mrs. Hen; can you tell me the way to the colonne?"&mdash;only, of
course, it being a French hen&mdash;if it was really a hen at all&mdash;she spoke to it
in French. The hen moved its head to the other side.</p>

<p>"La colonne, Madame, est l&agrave; bas, dans la prairie."</p>

<p>My wife danced for joy. It <i>was</i> a talking hen. The people were really
bewitched! "How lovely!" But I knew all the time that she was wrong.
The hen had not spoken&mdash;not a word. No such luck. It was that dark
girl, who had been watching us from the shed by the house. So we just
thanked her, for politeness sake, and walked sadly down the hill towards the
Colonne. I looked round. The hen was scratching again.</p>

<p>We found the Colonne at last&mdash;a fine one, of the composite Corinthian
style, its shaft beautifully ornamented with the favourite Roman leaf pattern.
Round the base are eight statues in relief. Every antiquary in the kingdom
has puzzled his brains over the motif of this column; and, except Courtep&eacute;e,
who says that "selon toute apparence c'est un monument s&eacute;pulcral,"<a id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
and Lempereur and Montfau&ccedil;on, who respectively believed it to be a Gaulish
tomb, and a religious monument, all agree that it is in memory of a great
victory.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>But what victory? One has said that it commemorates the
triumph of C&aelig;sar over the Helvetii <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 58; another that it was raised by
the Emperor Claude, conqueror of the Goths; others believe it to have been
erected by the Aedui to Maximian Hercules, after his victory over the
Bagaudes in 286 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>; finally the Burgundian, Girault, maintains that the
monument remembers the victory of Silius over Sacrovir in 22 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Beyond expressing a doubt whether the column is of later date than
100 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and my conviction that it is triumphal not monumental, I venture
no opinion upon any of these interesting theories. The antiquarians must
settle that among themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let me inform the visitor who may find himself there in the
autumn, that blackberries of a very choice quality grow in those prairies of
the Colonne. I devoured them steadily, while the cows chewed their cud,
and my wife sketched. She sketched; but she was not happy, as she usually
is when thus occupied. A cruel wind came out of the north, and chilled
her to the bone. She shivered; almost she wept. I, too, in spite of blackberries,
was all comfortless within, and felt an uncanny sensation in the
small of my back.</p>

<p>"Come along, Marjorie; you were quite right. It <i>was</i> the hen who
spoke. This place is bewitched." She cheered up.</p>

<p>"How lovely! I was so afraid witches had quite died out."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then we went home in the gloaming, by the same plucky, cheerful, little
train that puffed up the hills, and chattered tumbling down them. Opposite
to us, in the dimly-lit, bare apartment, a fat farmer and a slim little sister of
mercy slept, nodding in time to the jerks and vibrations that shook them from
head to foot.</p>

<p>At the first station a wrinkled old woman, leaning out of the window, held
so animated a debate with another on the platform, concerning peaches, that
the company were constrained to chip in, as one may do in democratic
France. Across the compartment came the laconic tones of an unseen
listener.</p>

<p class="pmb1">"Twenty sous the livre, for peaches! eh! ma foi!"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_251.jpg" width="360" height="660" alt="Roman Column at Cussy" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The train started, snorting violently; the old lady sat, firm-lipped, vigilantly
on guard among her baskets of fruit. There arose around her a running
commentary concerning peaches, and the ethics of trade therein.</p>

<p>"Moi, je vous dis"&mdash;"Eh bien moi je vous dis...."</p>

<p>"And half of them were rotten&mdash;the robber!" "Et quand m&ecirc;me!"
The old lady defended herself warmly.</p>

<p>"Rattle, rattle, rattle," commented the train, as it plunged downhill into
the pitchy darkness of the valley of Nantoux. Still the passengers babbled.
I grew weary of it, and my dreams went back to St. Martin, and the
Christianity he planted there. Were they really honest, these chattering
peasants? I thought of all the bad money palmed off on us in Burgundy&mdash;the
Italian, Spanish, Belgian rubbish; any coin at all that your carelessness
or trustfulness will accept. I thought of the lumps of lead unblushingly
handed to me in the dark by a Paris cabman, on the steps of St. Lazare. I
thought ... I yawned ... I joined the fat farmer and the slim
nun in dreamland.</p>

<p>"Beaune Ville!" said the guard. And the drowsy company searched
vacantly&mdash;every man for his pack.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During a hunt for Burgundian lore and legend among the libraries of
Beaune, we found ourselves in conversation with a very entertaining bookseller,
who described to us his boyhood holidays in the valley of Nantoux,
and the legendary haunts of St. Martin.</p>

<p>"Many a summer afternoon," he said, "we spent climbing the valley
hills, and playing upon the rock in which is St. Martin's well; and never
once, not even in the hottest summers&mdash;and some were very hot&mdash;did we
find the well dry. Always there was water in it. I cannot tell why. But
it was so."</p>

<p>Next morning I mounted my bicycle, and went to see for myself, whether,
after a week of cloudless October skies, I should find water in St. Martin's
well.</p>

<p>Following the valley road as far as Pommard&mdash;every name hereabouts is
borrowed unblushingly from a wine-list&mdash;you turn northward, and, always
following the railway, come to the little, grey village of Nantoux, where the
valley narrows, until you see, on your right, almost overhanging the road, a
ridge of jagged, grey rock, crossing the sparsely-wooded hill. Just before
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
it, on the Nantoux side, at a rather lower elevation, projects another shoulder
of the rock. There is the Puits de St. Martin.</p>

<p>If you call a passer-by, or one of the workmen in the roadside quarries, he
will show you the way, or take you up. It is not very easy to find without
help. You pass the overhanging cliff, and take a narrow path, at the first
bend of the road; not the wider one at the top of the slight ascent. I
enlisted the services of a brawny, good-tempered, blue-trousered young
quarryman, who landed me in a trice upon the terrace of weather-worn
rock, known locally as the Saut (leap) de St. Martin. As I stood facing the
gorge, my guide pointed to an oval-shaped, red-edged basin, not a foot in
diameter, filled, to within a few inches of the surface, with clear water.</p>

<p>"That is St. Martin's Well, Monsieur; it is never empty. And see, here
beside it is the mark of his horse's hoofs clear-cut in the rock. Those long
marks there were made by the lash of his whip. There are more hoof-prints
nearer the edge. He jumped clean across, in one bound. Ma foi! it needed
jarrets!"</p>

<p>We looked down at the rough-hewn gashes in the limestone. Gold-green
mosses, ivy, and warm, red rock plants were creeping out from every cranny
of the terrace, where of old the people beset St. Martin. Elderberry bushes
trembled in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Now look down the valley, Monsieur! There is Nantoux, towards the
midi where the rains come from. No rain while the sky is clear there.
Come now, and see the view up the valley."</p>

<p>Climbing to the topmost northward ridge, we found ourselves standing
before a majestic amphitheatre of dusky, brown hills of the C&ocirc;te d'Or,
whose threatening, almost terrible, aspect suggested rather the wicked brew
of a devil's cauldron, than the juice of the merry vines over which black
spider workmen were bending. Threatening clouds, driven before a rising
wind, darkened with flying shadows the narrow roads that serpented up to
the lofty, lonely villages of Mavilly and Mandelot. A rumbling sound
broke the silence. Below us we saw, writhing and snorting up the hill,
like a legendary, fire-breathing demon, a black train, fouling with wreaths
of purple smoke the lovely valley of Nantoux.</p>

<p>We returned to the Puits de St. Martin. Sitting on the very edge of the
cliff, we looked across at the wooded hill where the Saint alit, and down the
road, over the scrub, the vines, and the red quarries, still echoing the sound
of the pick; over the winding row of silvery willows and dark alders that
mark the valley stream bubbling towards the welcoming roofs of Beaune.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>There, in the very spot where it happened, the young quarryman told me
the story of St. Martin's Well. But I shall tell it you in my words, not
his&mdash;for story-telling was not his forte.</p>

<p>In the second century of the Christian era, Saint B&eacute;nigne and his companions,
coming from Asia, brought the Gospel of Christ into Burgundy.
The good news spread rapidly through the towns, but gained only a slow
hearing in the villages and the hamlets. Idol worship, driven from the cities,
found refuge among the remote hills and valleys of the land.</p>

<p>Mavilly, which, for centuries past, had possessed a college of Druids, remained
faithful to its gods, its priests, and its temple. Vauchignon, too,
whose hills, rocks, and woods, full of murmuring sounds and mysterious
terrors, was one of those natural sanctuaries dear to the heart of the Gaul,
still practised the heathen cult.<a id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>It is a warm autumn day; the holy missionary, Saint Martin, whose good
horse has borne him over the rugged mountain which rises between Mavilly
and the plain, has passed, one by one, through the villages of the C&ocirc;te d'Or.
At a crossing of the ways, in the midst of a great wood, he meets a little,
ragged, red-haired man, with fiery eyes and an anxious countenance. The
bishop offers him alms.</p>

<p>"Keep your silver piece," replies the stranger, "for I am more rich than
you."</p>

<p>Saint Martin, taking him for a herdsman of the country, asks him the
way to Mavilly.</p>

<p>"I know your object," replies the unknown man, laying hold upon the
horse's bridle, "and I will be your guide."</p>

<p>They go on in silence, and come, at length, to the slope of a vine-covered
hill where peasants are busy at the vintage. Martin, like Boaz of old in the
fields, salutes them:&mdash;"The Lord be with you!"</p>

<p>"Vintagers!" cries the guide, "Come hither in haste; I bring you the
great enemy of the gods. This man, on his way, destroys their statues and
breaks down their altars; he is come to destroy the temple that is the glory
and safety of your country. Rise and defend your gods!"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The angry peasants come running towards the speaker. They surround
the Saint and threaten him with the billhooks with which they are cutting
the grapes. Serenely the aged bishop looks round upon them; his calmness
disarms their anger. He is about to speak to them, but the red man knows
well that his cause is lost, if once the missionary obtains a hearing.</p>

<p>"Let us shut his impious mouth!" he cries to the vintagers. "His
blasphemies will bring down upon us the wrath of heaven. Cry aloud,
'Death! death to the denouncer of the gods!' Away with him to the edge
of the cliff, and hurl him down into the torrent!"</p>

<p>Loud rise the angry shouts of the crowd, as the guide leads away the
horse. Already they have reached the brink of the abyss. All is over; the
saint must die. Hemmed about on all sides, Martin cries:</p>

<p>"Come to my aid, O my God! make haste to help me!"</p>

<p>He signs himself with the cross, strikes, with his whip, the rock and
the flanks of his horse. The animal, with one mighty bound, clears the
valley, and alights upon the opposite peak. Immediately, around the spot
which he has just left, the earth trembles with an awful rending sound; a
rock is torn from the flank of the hill, and plunges into the torrent beneath,
bearing with it the false prophet, whose fall is marked by a flash of sulphurous
lightning. The troubled waters boil and bubble, as they close
over his body.</p>

<p>At the sight of such wonders, the vintagers stand dumb with astonishment.
Imprinted upon the granite rock they see the stroke of the rider's whip, and
the hoof-print of his horse, from which, already, a stream of limpid water is
flowing.</p>

<p>The old man, calm and majestic as before, standing motionless upon the
opposite peak, casts upon the peasants a compassionate glance. Terror-stricken,
they acclaim him a divine being. Then, swarming down the mountain
path to the valley, they climb the opposite peak, and again surround him.
But, this time, they lie prostrate at his feet, and, with prayers for pardon,
are about to adore him.</p>

<p>"Rise," says the bishop; "I am but a mortal, a vintager of Christ; and
your souls are the grapes I have come to gather in His name."</p>

<p>He bids them sit down upon the hill side, and there, before the temple of
the false gods, on the brink of the abyss into which Satan fell lightning-struck,
he speaks to them of the emptiness of their past worship, and reveals
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the power, the beauty, and the tenderness of the God of the Gospel. The
peasants, won at last from Paganism, descend to the temple, overthrow the
images, and bury them in many a deep trench.<a id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> They would destroy the
temple itself, but the pontiff restrains them.</p>

<p>"Not so; let us offer it to the true God, as a trophy won from the powers
of darkness; let Jesus be adored upon the altar whence Jupiter has fallen;
and let the Virgin Immaculate stand in the place of Venus."</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Be it so," replies the crowd, with one voice; "Let Christ reign and rule,
here where He has overthrown the Devil."</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>


<p class="p2">The little town of Verdun sur le Doubs has no particular attraction for the
arch&aelig;ologist nor for the tourist, yet it is a place with which all visitors to
Beaune who wish to keep themselves in touch with the real Burgundy, with
the life of the village and the ville de Canton, as well as with the larger
movements of the great cities, cannot afford to neglect.</p>

<p>For myself, the little town will always be associated with happy souvenirs,
and with gracious pictures of country life, as it has been since first I rode
there, on a warm September afternoon, along a pleasant, undulating road,
through typical, low-lying lands of fertile Burgundy, sometimes running
quite straight for several kilometres, sometimes curving slightly through
golden vineyards, and fields of bearded maize, and crimson clover. I passed
through St. Loup, a village with a delightful Romanesque church, and
through other attractive hamlets crowned with Gothic towers; by hay fields,
where a late second crop was being taken in, by rich arable lands, where
yoked oxen were ploughing with attendant women clearing the way for the
plough-share with a stick. I passed patches of fragrant wild flowers, and ill
weeds growing in tangled masses by the road side, by rich grasses that lean
cattle were stolidly munching.</p>

<p>One of the boys who looked after them was singing a song. I could not
catch the words exactly, nor the air, but I fitted the snatch of melody to the
best of all Burgundian folk-songs, an exquisite little poem with a curious and
very pretty history, that I am going to tell. This is the song. It is sung
to-day, with local variations, not by the shepherds of Burgundy only, but
throughout all France almost; in Dauphin&eacute;, in Champagne, in the lonely
forests of the Ardennes.</p>

<p>The French is so simple that, though I have appended no translation,
nearly all my readers will be able to feel some of the charm and lilt of the
original.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Generally speaking, of course, a folk song is not the work of one individual,
but of many; it is essentially a local product, that grows with the years,
and reflects truly the spirit of the land which gave it birth. Yet, strangely
enough, this particular song, though it has all the virtues of its kind&mdash;the
simplicity, the melody, the descriptive, pastoral, and amorous characteristics
of a semi-southern race&mdash;is an exception to the general rule.</p>

<p>When it first appeared, in 1840, in the Burgundian section of an important
work, "Les Fran&ccedil;ais peint par eux-m&ecirc;mes," the whole French nation welcomed
it as one of the best of its kind; and other provinces, as I have said,
did not hesitate to adopt it. It was held to be one of the most naive, and
authentically popular songs of all Burgundy,&mdash;Burgundy itself, even, had no
doubt whatever upon the subject. It was discussed everywhere in literary
circles; and that eminent writer, M. Catulle Mend&egrave;s, one evening, in the
presence of many other French lit&eacute;rateurs, openly expressed the opinion that
it was written by a young Burgundian shepherd, very much in love. Then
a strange thing happened. One of the oldest men present, the Burgundian
poet, M. Fran&ccedil;ois Fertiault, walked up to Mend&egrave;s, and said, with a smile:
"Eh, bien Monsieur, then I am that young Burgundian shepherd."</p>

<p>All the world wondered. The thing was impossible! It was not impossible;
it was true. Indeed, rightly regarded, it was simple, and natural.
M. Fertiault, living among the peasants and loving them, had absorbed all
that of which the folk song is born. The poetic spirit of a rural people had,
indeed, passed into him. What he had heard sung within him, he wrote.
M. Fertiault, still hale and hearty, after ninety seven years of active life,
told us the story himself, in his library, in the Rue Clausel, at Paris.</p>

<p class="pmb1">"I had to get material for this work," he said; "And though, for a dance
song, I had ready a Bourr&eacute;e Charollaise, and for a religious song, one of De
La Monnoye's Noels Bourguignons, I could find no example of the Chanson,
properly so called; nothing, nothing at all, that was complete enough to be
representative. The first part of my article was already published; the
remainder must go to press. What could I do? Then an idea came to me.
Only to attempt to carry it out was absurd. A minute later the attempt
seemed to be audacious; then merely bold; then perfectly possible. Soon
I knew that I must do it. The idea was growing in my brain. I felt something
at work here (tapping his forehead), something alive. I could see my
country; I could see my peasants. I was listening, listening. It all came
to me&mdash;an impression straight from life, with the scent of the fields in it.
I heard couplets, and a refrain. Yes, through the sweetness of the dream,
came a song. I heard words and music.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">For the words it was simple enough; but what to do for the tune?
Technically I was ignorant of music; I could not read the hieroglyphics that
are the language of Gounod and Rossini. I thought. Then I remembered
Scheffer; he knew of my search for a song. He would understand. It was
nearly eleven at night. With a feverish hand I was knocking at Scheffer's
door.</p>

<p>"You are not in bed?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; but it's about time."</p>

<p>"Are you sleepy?"</p>

<p>"I could be&mdash;if I liked."</p>

<p>"In that case, let me come in." My friendly neighbour opened wide the
door of his room. I hurried in.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said he, briskly.</p>

<p>"I have got my Burgundian song," said I, with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Where did you unearth it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. I made it. And as it needs you, here it is." Scheffer stood
in unspeakable astonishment. I told him my story. Then I added: "My
crime is double,&mdash;the air came to me with the words." My neighbour's
eyes opened wide. He thought me very mad indeed. "And," I added,
"musician that I am, I bring you my air; I can hear it buzzing in my head;
but my throat will not translate it properly."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" said he.</p>

<p>"I will hum it over to you, and we will piece it together on the piano."</p>

<p>"Bon. J'y suis. And together it was done&mdash;well done. We kept
silence. The next day the compositors were busy; and soon everyone was
reading the Burgundian Folk-Song, 'Eho.' I had succeeded." Now you
understand why one remembers a d&eacute;jeuner with Fran&ccedil;ois Fertiault.<a id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="pmb1">Here we are at the shining Sa&ocirc;ne, crossed by a suspension bridge that rocks
under the weight of every carriage we meet; and here, at the end of the
long avenue of poplars, beside the junction of the two rivers, is Verdun sur-le-Doubs.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that we are here I do not know that I have much to say about the
town itself, except that it is a peaceful little place, lying snugly beside its
waters that flow over golden sands.<a id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In the 14th century, however, Verdun
was a bonne ville ferm&eacute;e, one of the most ancient baronies of Burgundy, with
fortress, fairs, markets, fiefs, vassals, and all the other appointments of a
medi&aelig;val town; but the tides of war, sweeping, time after time, over this
part of the country, have left not even a ruin to remind us of its past.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_263.jpg" width="600" height="293" alt="Junction of Rivers Doubs and Sa&ocirc;ne" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Yet some incidents of that past are worth remembering; notably the siege
of 1350, following on a disastrous war between the Sieurs de Viennes and
the Seigneurs de Verdun, and again, in 1477 and 1478, when the Verdunois,
always prominent in their adherence to the Burgundian cause, refused to
accept the merger of their province into Louis XI.'s great kingdom of
France.</p>

<p>But the most memorable of all the bloody scenes in which Verdun has
played a part, was the great struggle of 1592, when the little town, the
strongest holding for Henry IV. in all Burgundy, sustained a desperate attack
under the Ligueurs, commanded by the Vicomte de Tavannes. At the head
of the Verdunois was H&eacute;liodore de Thiard de Bissy, and his brave wife,
Marguerite de Busseul-Saint-Sernin, who, to sustain the courage of the
defenders, voluntarily shared the fatigues and dangers of the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>She took
upon herself the duty of distributing, with her own hands, powder and
ammunition to her soldiers; until a spark set light to the barrels, and the
brave girl, blown to pieces, met a warrior's death. Young, beautiful,
generous, intrepid, and of noble birth, though she was, her heroic deed, by
some strange caprice of destiny, has not rescued her name from oblivion.</p>

<p>But the thoughts uppermost in my mind, in connection with Verdun, are
not historical, nor are they arch&aelig;ological. They hover rather about rural
Burgundy; the folk-lore, the old superstitions, and the intimate life of the
peasants, such as that of which M. Fertiault has made such good use in his
charming little story "The First of March."</p>

<p>Every year on the last day of February, when they think it will soon be
midnight, the women of the village leave their beds&mdash;I mean, of course, the
young women, the maids, with roses in their cheeks, and love in their hearts&mdash;and
await impatiently the first minute of the first hour of March, the
decisive minute for them. At the first stroke from the belfry tower their
windows fly open, each girl leans out, and whispers in the darkness her prayer
to Mars: "Bonjour, Mars; Comment te portes-tu Mars? Montre-moi dans
mon dormant celui que j'aurai dans mon vivant."<a id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Then they go back to bed, and their lovers come floating into their
dreams.<a id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Not very long ago in Arcy, the hamlet which gave its name to the famous
grottos that so many travellers have visited and described, dwelt two splendid
cocks, whose voices were the pride of the village. But a day came when
they were heard no more. The birds stood downcast, each upon his
favourite waste-heap, wheezing vainly from a voiceless throat. Then it was
known that they had been bewitched by a wicked sorcerer. Their owner
was in consternation. For who would wake him now in the morning and
hearten him cheerily for his day's work? So he went off to discuss his
trouble with one in the village who was known to be wise in these matters;
and this man told him at once the remedy.</p>

<p class="pmb1">"You must give the cocks," he said, "barley cooked at the rising of the
moon." The owner went home straightway; did as he was bid, and in the
grey light of the following morning, to his great joy, he was awakened by
his two chanticleers announcing lustily, from rival dung-heaps, the coming
of the dawn.</p>

<p class="p1">Not less fantastic, nor less poetical in conception, are some of the measures
adopted for the cure of personal ills. "Indeed," says M. Fertiault, "it is
difficult to conceive the amount of imaginative labour these rustic intelligencies
impose upon themselves, in their efforts to heal those who are dear
to them. They vie with one another in rummaging among old customs, to
find the best cure. Antoinette will take her sick Pierre to the church, and,
somehow or other, holding him by the hands and under the arms, will lead
him nine times round the altar so that health may come again; well she
knows, too, what healing virtue there is, for children's fevers, in the sweet
odour of hawthorn in spring; for did not the murderers of Christ weave for
him a crown of thorns."<a id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>It is around such places as Verdun, where the mind is not too much distracted
by arch&aelig;ological interests, that one's thoughts can escape from the
town, into the fertile surrounding lands, and picture scenes that M. Fertiault
has described for us so vividly, such as the autumn f&ecirc;te of the grand teillage
when they work far into the night, beside the great bonfires, the boys and
girls sitting around the piles of hemp. The work goes ahead speedily; and
much chaffing and many a merry jest inspire deft fingers to outdo one another
in peeling the hemp. The little mountains grow smaller, disappear. The
workers gather up what is left of the peeled stalks, and pile them upon the
fire which blazes again into a feu de joie. All dance round it gleefully;
some even jump through the tongues of flame, believing that courage will
make them incombustible. Then each takes his girl, and together they go
home through the autumn night, the maid and the boy she had seen in her
dreams six months ago, when, with her long hair falling about her face, she
had leaned from the window, to say "Good-morning" to March. And as
they go, they sing:</p>

<div class="block3">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Le mariage fait heureux</span>
<span class="i0">Les Amoureux."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"And if ever one day you love me less than you love me to-night?"</p>

<p>"Eh ben! ma foi?</p>

<p>"Eh ben! Pierre ... je mourrais." 'Tis time to say "Good-night" at the cottage gate.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Or it is a winter scene that comes. The copper lamp, hanging from a
beam, does its best, though not quite successfully, to play the part of the
moon upon a harvest field. Catherine plies her distaff busily, making her
bobbin hum; Toinette knits, steadily as a machine, a thick, woollen stocking;
Jacquot mends, with osier rushes, a basket for next summer's vintage.
Justin, sitting with his face to the back of his chair, is cutting, upon the blade
of an iron shovel, bunches of maize, of which the grains go raining down
and dancing up from the heaps in the vessel below. The old father, Claude,
does just nothing at all. A long life of hard work has well earned him some
idle hours; and he is content to sit and doze by the fireside; just throwing
in a word now and again; when the right cord is struck, or something reminds
him of a story of his early escapades, in the days when he was as Jacquot
is&mdash;with a good hand for the plough, a good heart for the girls, and a good

<p>So, through the quiet round of French rustic life, the generations are born,
are married, and pass again to the keeping of the earth that kept them.</p>

<p>The second of these episodes, marriage, in a family of any consequence,
in the olden time, was a charmingly elaborate and picturesque function.
Much of the poetry of it has now passed for ever; though, a few years back,
a prominent citizen of the locality decided to revive all the ceremonies at his
daughter's wedding, and did so with complete success.</p>

<p>I have not the space here to describe in detail, as I would&mdash;as M. Fertiault
has done so effectively in "Une Noce d'Autrefois en Bourgogne,"&mdash;all
that took place. But I cannot pass it by wholly in silence.</p>

<p>The wedding festivities extend over three days. The first day is full of
processions, and fife and drum, and flying ribbons, and sweetmeats, and
official journeys to summon from their abodes the Dames d'honneur, who
attend upon the bride. Then comes the municipal ceremony at the mairie&mdash;the
official marriage&mdash;and then the return to the H&ocirc;tel des Trois Maures,
where the bride and bridegroom, who, all the time have been scattering
sweetmeats right and left, receive, in their turn, an aspersion of grains of
corn, which come showering down upon them from the upper windows.
This is the ceremony of "Sowing the &eacute;pous&eacute;s"; the golden rain is a blessing
upon the marriage, a poetical invocation of the good-will of Plenty's
Goddess.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Then before the spread feast, comes the <i>tremp&eacute;e</i>, the health-drinking, a
very significant function in a wine country. But first they clink glasses&mdash;for
franc Bourguignon, on ne boit jamais sans trinquer&mdash;and having drunk,
clink again, and all relatives and intimates&mdash;relatives embrace cousins, as the
boy's latin book darkly hints&mdash;give the bride the baiser de la tremp&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Then there is feasting, more healths, more music; then a general cry for
the farandole, and in an instant they are wreathing it, uninvited and all, in
hall, and lane, and street; fife and tambourine and flying feet are at it with
an &eacute;lan that even that sunny land of song and dance, Provence, would find
it hard to equal. In the evening there is a great ball given to the guests,
and, on the next days, more processions, and a ball for the uninvited, at which
the bride and bridegroom appear for a few minutes, open the dancing with a
contre-danse, and then withdraw.</p>

<p>The third day's round is somewhat similar, but there are fewer ladies
present&mdash;many of them have had enough&mdash;and one notices, walking behind
the drums and fifes, an individual carrying a laurel&mdash;not a branch, but a bush,
well-grown and decked with ribbons. At the maison paternelle a halt is
made, and all gather round to admire the laurel. Then he calls for the
strongest volunteers to assist the bearer.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, you six?" "Yes," in six voices.</p>

<p>"You know the job is none so easy&mdash;dangerous too?"</p>

<p>"No fun if it wasn't."</p>

<p>"To it, then."</p>

<p>"Tie it well!"</p>

<p>"And as high as you can!"</p>

<p>"Come down now&mdash;and take care!"</p>

<p>They have to tie the laurel to the highest chimney of the house.</p>

<p>They mount gaily, for they are very excited, and, moreover, have a bottle
with them, a bottle of good wine; good, sparkling, red wine that is pushing
at the cork. They are going to sprinkle the tree with it. Happy tree!</p>

<p>But the boys have had their share these days&mdash;'tis fairly the tree's turn.
So they mount to the roof, called the <i>lid</i> in the locality.</p>

<p>"Not too steep, is it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you stick it?"</p>

<p>"Rather&mdash;comfortable as an armchair!" At last it is done, well done,
with a good stout cord.</p>

<p>"Look out for the baskets, John!" John pours prodigally, till the wine
is trickling down the wall, and making a little rivulet in the street.</p>

<p>"Long life to the laurel" yell the five others. "Long life to the porteur."</p>

<p>"A la sant&eacute; des camarades."</p>

<p>All glasses are charged; then comes the clash of a trinquade, and, in an
instant, every glass is drained. Jests fly about, and laughter. There is more
drinking, more trinquades.</p>

<p>"La ronde, the round of the laurel! Allons!"</p>

<p>"Hands for the round&mdash;and hold tight."</p>

<p>Beating time with their feet, they dance round the chimney, until the
tiles resound, singing:</p>

<p>The laurel is well fixed, the drums cease. From every window of the
house, besieged by the gamins, pours down a shower of sugar plums. The
timid ones get what they can, the greedy fight and struggle. After the mass
it is still worse; there is many a sore head for souvenir. Fameux! Fameux

<p class="p1">While we are talking about these ancient customs, let us spare a word or
two for the tongue which was heard through so many of them&mdash;the patois.
The Burgundian patois, to use Sainte-Beuve's picturesque expression&mdash;"a eu
des malheurs"; it has never become a living language as the Breton and the
Proven&ccedil;al have, and is therefore doomed, I suppose, to early destruction; as
its older devotees die off, and the young peasant, versed in the language of
towns, learns to despise his father's tongue.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Perrault-Dabot, in his excellent little work on the subject,<a id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> tells us
that, as might have been expected, all the many races that have inhabited or
influenced Burgundy&mdash;the Eduens, the Romans, the Flemish&mdash;have left their
traces upon its local tongue. Its chief defect, he adds, is that, like the
country itself, half plain half mountain, it lacks unity. Placed between the
two great centres of the Langue d'Oil and Langue d'Oc, it has naturally
drawn from both. In accent, its chief characteristics are vivacity, expression,
and charm; it comes between the northern lisp and the resonant redundance
of the southern tongue, and is spoken in a sing-song manner not easily rendered
typographically. It has many peculiar words, phrases, and idioms, but
does not appear to have taken definite form until the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, when it was spoken in all the provinces of eastern and
central France, and also in the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland), which once
formed part of the ancient kingdom of Burgundy.</p>

<p>To the practised ear, a Burgundian reveals his origin at once, by the way
he pronounces his <i>a's</i>. A becomes &acirc; (ah) in all words such as <i>cave</i>, <i>table</i>,
<i>Jacques</i>, terminated by a dumb syllable, and the O is shortened in all words
ending in <i>ot</i> or <i>op</i>, such as <i>gigot</i> or <i>sirop</i>.</p>

<p>The Burgundian offers no exception to the general rule that the words
peculiar to a dialect are often very beautiful. Provence gives us "voun,
voun" for the hum of the bees, Normandy gives us "boisettes" for the dead
sticks that the peasants gather for faggots; while from Burgundy we get
"faublette" for a little tale. For "beggar," instead of a brutal word like
"mendiant," they say "cherchou de pain." There is purity in their
dialect, as in their customs.</p>

<p class="pmb3">While writing these pages upon the old creeds and customs of rustic
Burgundy, I have felt strongly, as a foreigner, my inefficiency for such a task,
and have wished that I could hand over my pen to the Burgundian poet, my
friend, M. Fran&ccedil;ois Fertiault, by whose kind permission I am able to make
use of so much material that is his, and to whom any merit there may be in
this chapter is wholly due. Had his still firm and active, though aged hand,
taken up my task, my readers would well have been able to say, as the
peasants of Burgundy, with one voice, have said of his work: "Y&eacute; ben vr&acirc;
qu' tout c'qui s'passe cheu nous."</p>

<p class="pmb2" />


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>


<p class="p2">When the train from Bourg had left the valley, and commenced its
mountainous passage across the Jura, en route for Nantua, we felt that, historically,
if not geographically, we were leaving Burgundy for an intermediate
land that, while ceasing to be France, was not quite Switzerland.
Yet, for all that, the journey is worth making, for the sake of the loveliness
of the hills, and the links it forms in your mind between what you have left,
and the regions of lake and mountain that once formed part of the old Kingdom
of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The passage of the viaduct over the Suran soon reconciles you to the
Cimmerian darkness of Jura tunnels. Hundreds of feet below winds the
blue river mackerel-backed, beside terraced lawns of rich, green grass, between
banks of dark fir-wood, through which silvery, snowy waterfalls come
swirling and splashing down to the valley stream.</p>

<p>Almost equally beautiful is the crossing of the Ain that follows. At
length, after some fifty kilometres of charming surprises, you leave La Cluse
and jog onward, until the bend of the line shows you the red roofs and white
church-tower of the little town of Nantua reflected in the dark waters of
the placid lake, ringed round with upland meadows, and steep, fir-clad hills.</p>

<p>Here, for a few days, we ceased to see things. We just idled, lounged,
looked on. Only too soon we learned that this is not Burgundy, but a
pocket edition of Switzerland, a tourist resort, where the hotel is more expensive,
and the gamins hail you with cries of "Oh! yes!" But if this spot has
Swiss drawbacks, it has Swiss beauties, too; ce que est d&eacute;j&agrave; quelque chose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on a lovely autumn morning, that, after a breakfast made memorable
by mountain honey, we climbed the hills above the town, and basked
in the rays of the sun, that shone from a cloudless sky. Such sun-heat has
not been felt in Burgundy all this frozen summer and vineless fall. We
bathed in it with infinite joy. Below us flickered, golden green, the grasses
of an upland meadow, where the hay-makers were busy raking over the last
crop. Lower down, across a fringe of branches tossing in the north wind,
shone in soft, warm colours, grey, brown, and red, the roofs and walls of
ancient Nantua, crowned with the tower of the Romanesque Church, whose
sides and sculptured shafts and capitals challenged, in the fierce morning
light, the pitchy shadows that lurked in every rounded arch.</p>

<p>Through the angle, formed by the tower and the mottled roof of the nave,
one caught a glimpse of shops in the main street. From the gable of one of
them flapped the tricolor flag of France. People passed beneath it&mdash;black
specks, like flies walking. Beyond lay the blue lake, breeze-ruffled, striped
like a fish's back in shades of azure and grey, passing now and then into buff
and yellow, where the waters reflected the naked rock&mdash;the whole framed,
hemmed in by rugged cliffs, whose lower slopes are clothed in scrub and
trees of every tint, from black to green and gold. The topmost rocks&mdash;jagged,
bare, vertical faces broken with black patches, and streaked, on the
sunny side, with bright, zig-zag paths&mdash;threaten the town and lake beneath.
Unbroken shadows still enveloping the eastern cliffs, throw into stronger
relief the gleaming water, and opposite shore quivering in the morning light.
Westward only can the eye escape from these rugged beauties to the gentler
slopes of the Jura beyond La Cluse.</p>

<p>Wandering dream-hunter that I am, it is there that I find myself gazing,
at these shining, shining waters, and beyond them, to the real Burgundy, to
the memories of her glorious past still lingering in the Palace of Dijon, and
the mother abbeys of the west. While my wife sketched Nantua, and
envied the hay-makers their arms, I thought of Cluny and of Citeaux, of
things, in fact, symbolized in that Romanesque tower below.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Walking through the town, on our way back to our hotel, we entered a
shop, and nearly fell over a small child&mdash;some seven years old&mdash;who was
playing on the doormat with shells and bits of glass. She jumped up at once,
adjusted her long, straight, red hair, worn in two plaits; and turned to us a
round, sweet, intelligent little face.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"Bonjour, Monsieur et Dame!" she said.</p>

<p>"Bonjour, Mademoiselle," we replied; and looked round for the shop-keeper.
There was no other. This was the shop-keeper&mdash;this baby, with
the sweet face and red plaits; now a woman, official, dignified, alert.</p>

<p>"You desire post-cards, 'Sieur et Dame? Here is a tray-full&mdash;please
choose."</p>

<p>We chose. Our dame de comptoir looked on, graciously. The cards
were handed to her to count: The little red head was ready first with the
figure.</p>

<p>"Ca fait dix-neuf sous, Monsieur. Yes, I have change. Do you desire
stamps?" Stamps and change were instantly forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Voil&agrave;, Bonjour M'sieur-Dame!"</p>

<p>From twenty yards away we looked back. A sweet child with ted pigtails
was playing with shells on the doormat.</p>

<p>Don't believe people who tell you that French women are not born
capable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="pmb3">The church of Nantua is worth a visit. It has a good Romanesque fa&ccedil;ade,
carved with the usual energy and freedom of the Burgundy school; but the
capitals are mutilated, as is the tympanum at the first order of the arch. The
interior is in the usual Burgundian style. The nave has square pillars with
engaged vaulting shafts; but the original ceiling has been replaced by a
thirteenth-century ribbed vault, springing from corbel-capitals at the same
height as the vaulting shafts. The thrust of the vaults has forced the pillars
outwards both ways, and flying buttresses of a very substantial kind have been
built to hold the church together. The tower, of later date than the body
of the church, is the best in the district. Other points worth noticing are
the barrel-vaulted transept, the primitive vaulting of the ceiling, the frescoes
in the choir, and the westward slope of the floor.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>


<p class="p2">Our strongest impression of Bourg en Bresse&mdash;apart from its associations
with the Eglise de Brou&mdash;was that it brought us almost within hail of the
beloved Midi. As at M&acirc;con, the sun, when it shone, was aggressive. You
welcomed the sight of leafy plane trees, you hugged the shady side of the
road. Good peaches were to be had for a sou la pi&egrave;ce; and the cattle wore
hats&mdash;red and yellow tassels and elaborate string fly-protectors bound about
their foreheads. These things are full of significance for one who has seen
the south.</p>

<p>Another memory is the ill-manners of the townspeople. The attentions
of the folk at Paray were but neglect when compared with the fixed stare
of Bourg. One delinquent was so absorbed in us that he nearly wrecked
his motor in the open street: another fell down the hotel stairs; there were
three cases of abrasion. The fact that these victims had obviously not forgotten
the "convenances," only made more striking their failure to observe
them. They appeared to have no control over certain faculties. Both sexes
had forgotten how to blush. They wrought me to anger, and my wife to
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>But such trifles, after all, are merely the "petit d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ments" of travel&mdash;remembered
only with a smile; relics of primitivism, such as was the service
de la gare&mdash;omnibuses still running, not so much as varnished since the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>"C'est ancien" said a hotel porter, with a wave of the hand. "C'est
un monument historique," added a bystander. The porter smiled, as his
hand closed mechanically over a franc.</p>

<p>We rode, that first afternoon, to Cezenat, on the slopes of the Jura. The
aspect of the country round was harsher than that of central Burgundy, and
the light fiercer; the landscape, as a whole, lacks the soft charm of the vine-clad
C&ocirc;te d'Or, without attaining to the romantic quivering whiteness of the
vrai midi. It was very delightful to rest before the caf&eacute; opposite to the
church of Revonnat, and watch the shapely, creamy cattle, following the
swarthy maid to the water-trough beneath the virgin-crowned fountain.
They drank steadily, until a long stick, rattling about their shiny muzzles,
made them raise mildly-protesting heads. They walked home with unruffled
dignity, a processional frieze of madonnas&mdash;their faces veiled, as befits
holiness.</p>

<p>More, and then more, came tinkling by, driven by a diminutive boy. They
disappeared down a winding lane, and were followed by four horses,
harnessed tandem, wearing the three-horned attelage of the Midi, and
stamping, swishing their tails, and tossing heads, till all the village was vocal
with their music. After them waddled a fat woman, leaking seed, and followed
by a hundred hungry fowls. Last of all, two piebald oxen, harnessed
in front of a skinny pony, tugged wearily up the hill the household goods of
a whole family piled upon a creaking cart.</p>

<p class="pmb1">With the exception of a few old houses and the world-famous Brou,
there is very little architecture worth seeing in Bourg. Or, if there is, it
did not detain us long. We made at once for Princess Margaret's Church,
rather more than a kilometre distant from the lower part of the town, at the
end of a long, straight, squalid road. There we found it&mdash;this jewel ill-set.
The authorities, with the cynical apathy, or ignorance, that characterises
French ecclesiasticism, have surrounded the building, on the west and north,
with a gravelled open space, like the playground of a board-school, adorned
with a tawdry crucifix, and a lavatory, the whole enclosed within an ignoble
wall. Why the French public tolerate such outrages is a mystery!</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_278.jpg" width="464" height="660" alt="Bourg; in the Street" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I suppose that, in this case, darkness is just ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Yet before their very
eyes are evidences that it was not always so. The pictures in their church
show that the "parvis" was originally planted with shrubs, which would grow
as readily to-day as they did then; failing a grassy lawn, and the money or
men to keep it green and trim.</p>

<p>Enough of the setting&mdash;what of Princess Margaret's Church? Looking
up at it, we are reminded, at once, of her Flemish sympathies. The high
gables of this west front&mdash;of which the centre one is lightened by a rose
and three triangular windows, symbols of eternity and the Trinity&mdash;recall
the splendid architecture of Bruges and the Rhine country. Rich flamboyant
carving is to be seen everywhere; yet the effect is more striking than
successful. The fa&ccedil;ade is surrounded with elaborate embellishments, that,
jostling with one another, break the harmony of line; the ornament is tortured,
and conveys the impression that it is merely hung upon the Church;
the figures in the tympanum below the flat-arched portal, are poor in execution;
the tower is mean and insufficient. Yet we must not hasten to condemn.
This fallen Gothic, though marred by the defects of its qualities,
and, beyond question, fundamentally decrepit, has yet wintry graces all her
own. Her death days were neither ignoble, nor frozen; rather they were
instinct with a repentant animation, and warmed by a delicate flush, the hope
and vision of coming spring.</p>

<p>Yes, despite the wanton waste of ornament, despite intemperance and lack
of restraint, there is pathos, there is beauty, even, in these splendid agonies
of a matchless art. That proud princess of ancient lineage, lying stricken
in her darkened chamber, where yet lingered the shadows of a passing night,
bent timidly, fearfully, her dreamy, dying eyes upon the before and after,
upon what had been and was yet to be; until, gathering strength for a last
effort, the frail, fair, white hand, drawing apart the silken folds of the
curtain, caught, through the glowing casement, a glimpse of a golden dawn
brightening a yet lovelier world, and smiled to see the pure radiance of a
happier, more human belief touching with the tender light of a new-born
hope the sterner mysticism of her earlier discarded faith. The discarded
faith was medi&aelig;valism; that new-born hope we call the Renaissance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Come with me into the building, and, before I tell Margaret's story, look,
for a moment, round this amazing church. The nave, though it conveys
at once to the mind of the devotee of pure Gothic, a sensation of wintry
decadence, that neither the richness of the lovely <i>jub&eacute;</i>, nor a glimpse, through
its open door, of the wonderful marble tombs within the choir, can quite
dispel, is pleasing in its grace and simplicity, qualities which the exterior
would not have led you to expect. So restful, too, are the flowing lines of
the columns and engaged colonnettes rising, unbroken by capitals, to the low
vaults, that one imagines the architect to have planned deliberately this cool,
white marble hall, in which worshippers could soothe spirits wrought to
intensity by sights seen within. They may well have needed such repose,
since we need it to-day; though the love which brought this church into
being was left lonely four hundred years ago. Pass through that open
doorway, and see for yourself. You stand in a maze of sculptures, among
a thousand flowers, figures, emblems, devices, and myths, feminine fantasies
carved everywhere, in regal profusion upon many a pedestal and column,
upon shadowy niches and overhanging tabernacles, upon dainty shaft, and
lightest fretwork pinnacle, their marble whiteness all warmed in blue,
crimson, and golden light streaming from the painted windows. Whether
you look down upon the blue enamelled bricks at your feet,<a id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> at the silent
figures beneath those strangely decorated canopies, and the myriad carven
shapes about them, or whether you look up at the resplendent saints, kings,
and nobles ablaze upon the panes, your sensation is one of unsatisfied wonder,
and you know yourself to be in a building, that, for all its faults, is unrivalled
in the world of art. Let me tell how it came to be so.</p>

<p>The story of Margaret d'Autriche, the unfortunate princess to whom we
owe this extraordinary Eglise de Brou, is closely linked with events and
personalities already mentioned in these pages. Born in 1480, she was the
daughter of Maximilian and Marie de Bourgogne, and grand-daughter of
Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire. In the closing years of his life, that old fox,
Louis XI., had chosen her out as the future wife of his Dauphin, and would,
no doubt, have had his will, had not his erstwhile ally, death, turned against
him at last, and claimed forfeiture.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>The childhood of Marguerite passed peaceably in that lovely Ch&acirc;teau of
Amboise by the Loire, in the company of her official husband, Charles VIII.,
and his French Court, was not foreshadowed by sorrows that were soon to
come. The King torn between desires to unite Burgundy and Brittany to
the French crown, and finding that he could not have both, decided in favour
of the latter. Acting upon that decision, he broke his sworn faith to
Marguerite, dismissed his fianc&eacute;e, and married Anne of Brittany. Marguerite
left in anger; nor did she ever forgive Charles. Henceforth, France was
her enemy. So, for many years, was Fortune. The next stroke fell swiftly.</p>

<p>In April, 1497, Marguerite married Juan, Prince of Castille, the son of
Ferdinand and Isabella, who died of fever at Salamanca in the same year&mdash;a
misfortune that&mdash;if we are to believe her historiographer, Jean Lemaire&mdash;neither
crushed the girl's spirit, nor extinguished her natural wit; "for, being
on shipboard, and having passed a horrible and tempestuous night, in fear of
perilous shipwreck, as the following day the sea had been calm and tranquil,
while Marguerite was conversing with her maids upon their past fears and
perturbations, the proposal was made that each should compose her own
epitaph; whereupon she promptly composed her own in this manner":</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cy gist Margot la gentil' Damoiselle,</span>
<span class="i0">Q'u ha deux marys et encore est pucelle."<a id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Truly a very joyous epitaph, as Lemaire says, "si plein de vraie urbanit&eacute;."
Not so did she salute the death of her next husband.<a id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>It was on the 26th of September, 1501, that was signed the treaty of her
marriage with Philibert le Beau, Duke of Savoy&mdash;the event that first links
Marguerite's story with that of Brou.</p>

<p>The fifth of August in the following year, when Philibert and Marguerite
paid their first visit to Bourg, was a memorable day in the annals of the town.
Artillery boomed, joy bells clashed; every house was bright with gay hangings
of all colours, with festoons, and the arms of Burgundy and Savoy. Soon
the call of the trumpet drew all the crowd to the Town Hall, whence issued
the corps municipal, preceded by the syndics clothed in red robes, one of
whom bore the keys of the town upon a silver plate.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>The procession moved
slowly forward, to the beat of music, until a warlike fanfare of trumpets,
and the neighing of horses, announced the coming of the ducal cort&egrave;ge, at the
head of which rode Philibert and Marguerite. Loud were the cries of joy
that greeted the young couple. On a prancing steed, decked with rich
draperies, bearing the arms of Burgundy, its beautiful head plumed with
tossing white feathers, rode Marguerite, wearing the ducal crown. Through
the folds of her silver veil, spectators could obtain a glimpse of a gracious
face, and long fair tresses. Her dress was of crimson velvet, embroidered in
gold, showing upon the skirt the escutcheons of Austria and Savoy. In one
hand she held her reins, the other was lifted in gracious salutation to the
crowd. At her right ambled the Duke Philibert, proud of the reception that
Bourg was according his lady.</p>

<p>Philibert le Beau was a handsome, gay, debonair prince, who loved to give
to music and good cheer all the hours he could spare from his favourite
pastime of the hunt. He left to his ministers exclusively all such troublesome
matters as affairs of State. Such was the young gallant who rode by
Marguerite's side through the streets of Bourg.</p>

<p>Every house, as we have said, was gay with blazoned arms and bunting.
On a great scaffold before the Church of Notre Dame, the preaching friars
were presenting mystery plays, the Christian legends of St. George and of
the Archangel St. Michael. On the scaffolds, in various parts of the town,
were figured scenes from mythological history. The Labours of Hercules,
or Jason's encounters with monsters and dragons during his quest of the
Golden Fleece. Before the town wall, in the presence of a crowd so dense
that a way could scarcely be cleared for the duchess, was represented the
allegory of "The Fountain and the Maid," in which, from the metal
breasts of a gigantic female figure, two jets of wine splashed into the basin
below.</p>

<p>During the three short years of Philibert's married life, the peace of
Europe was untroubled, and the Duke of Savoy was forced to appease his
military ardour in tournament and hunt. A chronicler of the time has left
us a detailed account of the jousts held on the occasion of the marriage of
Laurent de Gorrevod, at the Castle of Carignan. Philibert bore himself so
bravely in the lists, that the ladies, with one consent, "benign and not ungrateful,
knowing the honour and the great and mighty feats of arms done for
love of them, advised that by right and without favour, the honour and prize
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
of the combat should be given to Duke Philibert. Wherefore the said
ladies desired him that he would of his grace accept the ring presented to
him on their behalf by a young and fair demoiselle&mdash;which supplication, as
one full of honour, courtesy, and benignity, thanking the said ladies, their
said ring and present he graciously accepted."<a id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>The Duke's favourite hunting-seat was at Ch&acirc;teau de Pont-Ain,<a id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> high
up on the hill overlooking Bresse and Bugey. Many a day the dark woods
around echoed the merry note of the horn, and the deep bay of his hounds,
as Philip and Marguerite rode forth together. She with "the ivory horn
hung in a sling, mounted on a spirited palfrey, followed her very dear lord
and spouse, in hot chase of the horned stags, by wood and plain, by mountain
and valley, fearing not the ardour of the sun nor the toil of the hunt, so that
by her careful presence she could guard him from all misfortune."</p>

<p>On a very hot morning, in September, 1504, the young prince, led far
afield by the excitement of the chase, "and almost separated from his party,
who could follow him no longer, was passing, at mid-day, a long and narrow
valley, on foot, because his horses, by reason of the long ride, were dead or
broken down."</p>

<p>Arriving, breathless and bathed in perspiration, at the Fontaine St. Vulbas,
he was charmed by the cool shade of the place, and ordered his meal to be
served to him there. Before long, feeling himself seized with a sudden
shivering fit, he ordered his horse, and began his homeward journey, "holding
his hand to his chest, then commencing to bend forward and to be in
great agony." He reached the Castle at last, and threw himself down upon
a camp bed, "beside which came soon, all troubled in heart, the very dear
Duchess, his very dear spouse and companion, who, seeing her lord and friend
lying ill, and nevertheless not knowing as yet of her great mourning so soon
to be, began to comfort him very sweetly, and to cheer him with all her
power."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>For several days the young prince battled with a violent attack of pleurisy;
but, at last, in spite of bleeding and many prayers, even his strong constitution
gave way, and the lovers knew that they must part. "And himself feeling
his end drawing near, rose and would fain bid an eternal farewell to his very
loved companion, holding her in a strong embrace." He died in the arms
of Marguerite, on the 10th September, 1504, in the very room in which he
had been born, twenty-four years before, in the Ch&acirc;teau de Pont-d'Ain.</p>

<p>The brief days of Marguerite's happiness were closed. Coming years
were to bring their measure of consolation to the stricken woman; but, as she
herself, a poetess of sorrow, wrote in verse, whose graceful melodies recall
the plaintive notes of Charles D'Orl&eacute;ans, henceforth for her</p>

<p>So poor Marguerite adopted a new device, the last and saddest of three
comments upon her destiny.<a id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> You may read it to-day, a hundred times,
on the walls, the tombs, the windows of the church of Brou.</p>


<p class="p2 center font11 pmb1">FORTUNE. INFORTUNE. FORT UNE.<a id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1505 that Margaret laid with her own hand the
first stone of the building she had dreamed of ever since her husband's death,
a church which would, at the same time worthily perpetuate the memory
of their loves, and accomplish the unfulfilled vow of her mother, Marguerite
de Bourbon, who had sworn many years before to erect a church to the glory
of God, should her husband recover from an illness that then threatened his
life.</p>

<p>The princess chose for her architect Loys van Boghen, a Flamand of great
ability, under whose direction the whole fabric of the church was constructed.
The statues and sculptures were in the hands of "Maistre
Conrard, le consomm&eacute; tailleur d'ymages," between whom and the difficult,
quarrelsome Loys considerable friction seems to have arisen. This we
gather from the archives of Ain.<a id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Insomuch as Maistre Loys is somewhat light of word and threat towards
one and another, both ecclesiastic and secular, whence much scandal may
arise, as indeed has already chanced, and our Lady's work thereby retarded,
the said Maistre Loys is thereby expressly forbidden and prohibited henceforth
from using such threats and words; and should he notwithstanding
attempt to do so, he will be held accountable therefore to our Lady in his
person and goods. The same shall be said to Maistre Conrard and to all
other whom it may concern."<a id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>At length, stone by stone, in spite of Maistre Loys' temper and the
awful famine and pestilence, which, in those years, were ravaging the town
of Bourg, Marguerite's darling project approached completion. Many a day
would she ride over from the Castle of Pont d'Ain, where she was passing
the early years of her widowhood, to watch her beloved building growing
beneath her eyes.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The closing years of Marguerite's life were passed in administering,
wisely and justly, the affairs of the Pays Bas, of which country she had long
been appointed governor. Her wealth, her great abilities, and her exalted
rank all combined to render her one of the most prominent figures in the
political life of the time.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Francis I., after his defeat at Pavia, sought her
good graces; she was courted of many; her voice was loud in the counsels of
Europe. But Marguerite, who had already refused the hand of Henry VII.
of England, was not to be dazzled by the glitter of a crown. Long ago she
had renounced wedded life, until friendly death should lay her once more
beside Philibert in those bridal tombs. Her inmost thoughts, far away from
thrones and principalities, were turning towards the cloister, as a fitting
refuge from the cares of state, when, in 1530, her unhappy life was brought
to a sudden close. This is the traditional story of her death, as told in a
manuscript of the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>On the fifteenth of the month of November, in the morning, before rising,
she asked for a drink of water from one of her attendants, Magdeleine of
Rochester, who, obeying her immediately, brought the water in a crystal cup;
but, while taking it back, she unfortunately let the glass fall in front of the
bed, where it was smashed to pieces. The girl gathered the fragments up, as
carefully as she could, but did not think of looking into her Royal mistress's
slippers. Some hours later, Princess Marguerite put on her slippers, and
walked to the fire. Feeling a violent pricking sensation in her left foot, she
called a lady in waiting, who found a fragment of the broken cup firmly
embedded therein. This she drew out, as carefully as she could, and the
princess, with her usual courage, made light of the matter, and dismissed it
from her mind.</p>

<p>Some days after, she began to feel great pain in the foot, and noticed that
the limb was swollen. Physicians were summoned, who, after private consultation,
decided that the wound was gangrened, and that amputation was
the only practicable means of saving the patient's life. They communicated
their decision to Mont&eacute;cut, the princess's confessor, and asked him to break
the news to his mistress. She was much surprised, but bore bravely what she
must have known to be virtually a sentence of death. The next few days
having been passed in confession, absolution, and the settlement of her
temporal affairs, she submitted herself to her doctors, who proceeded to administer
to their patient so large a dose of opium "that they put her to a
sleep so sound that it is not yet ended, and will not end until the Resurrection
of all the dead."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Marguerite was buried at Malines, where her body lay for two years, until,
her tomb being ready, she was laid, in 1532, according to the express terms
of her will, beside her "lord and husband," who was to rest between his
mother and his wife.</p>

<p>There you may see her to-day lying, proud and lovely, as in life, her royal
face still turned to the man to whose glory, rather than to God's, she had
raised those astounding memorials of a woman's devotion. There, in flaming
colour upon the purpled panes, in blazoned device upon floor and wall, in a
thousand delicate fancies, wrought, with most exquisite art, upon the pale,
white marble of the tombs, and altar pieces, you may read the story of her
life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are now in a position to realize why the church, though built by men,
breathes femininity. It was the expression of a woman's mind, the love
offering of a lady to her lord. As such, all women's virtues are expressed
in it&mdash;dignity and grace in the flowing lines of the nave, purity in the whiteness
of the marble, wit and ingenuity in the legends and devices, daintiness
in the exquisite detail; courage, patience, and devotion, revealed everywhere
in the complete unity of the whole.<a id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> And those women's virtues carried
with them women's faults&mdash;a certain lack of breadth and vision; over-elaboration
of detail, and a love of prettiness that verges upon the petty.<a id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
All these things are apparent. But the greatest defect of all&mdash;the subordination
of design to ornament&mdash;is as much the fault of the age as of the
individual. These were the years of transition.</p>

<p>The old greatness had passed; the new greatness in building was not yet
come. In that sense this church is inherently decadent.</p>

<p>When men of the early middle ages reared their mighty fanes to God and
to his saints, they lifted vault and roof into echoing airy spaces, where the
rapt worshippers, looking upward, might seek haply after God; but here is
no upward call. This roof is low, flattened, heavy; threatening, almost, to
fall upon the heads bent in prayer. The builders of pure Gothic loved to
ornament their churches with the richest sculpture that skilful, reverent hands
could carve; and they sought their inspirations in Nature alone, who shapes
the tree before she decks it with leaves, and fashions the plant before the
flower.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>But these later men, losing sincerity, lost truth; they thought of the
leaf before the limb, and of blossom rather than of bough. That is why
Brou leaves us unsatisfied. Yet, as I have said, we must not blame utterly.
Whatever architect and sculptor may have lacked, one thing they did not
lack&mdash;patience. And if patience were indeed genius, as Buffon says it is,
then is genius here, too. Surely, the most fastidious spectator may say with
Paradin, the old chronicler of Savoy, "apr&egrave;s tout estant l&eacute;ans (&agrave; Brou),
semble que voyez un songe, et ne savez &agrave; quoi premierment addresser vos
yeux pour les repaistre, parce qu' une chascune chose se convie &aacute; regarder
comme un nouveau spectacle."</p>

<p>We have no space left in which to deal with details of the tombs, the
choir stalls, altar pieces, and other marvels the church contains. The reader
must discover them for himself; we can only give a few general impressions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_b_290.jpg" width="300" height="108" alt="Eglise de Brou: Ornament from the Tomb of Marguerite d'Autriche" title="" />
</div>

<p>As you face the east end of the Church, the tomb of Marguerite d'Autriche
is on your left, that of Philibert le Beau in the centre, and that of
Marguerite de Bourbon on the right. This last, the earliest of the three,
is obviously inspired by
the royal tombs at
Dijon, but, having no
base, it lacks their dignity,
just as it lacks
their harmony and simplicity.
The pleurants
are very poor, when
compared with those of
Claus Sluter and his nephew. The minute detail is extraordinarily good,
but there is a superabundance of ornament, and the whole is tortured and
conscious. The meaning of the device bearing the letters F E R T has
been much debated. Some say that it represents Fortitudo Ejus Rhodum
Tenuit, or Tuetur, in memory of Am&eacute;dee le Grand's victory over the Turks;
others that it is a chevaleresque French device; Frappez, Entrez, Rompez
Tout. The guide, however, gave us Fide et Religione Tenemur, as the
true solution.</p>

<p>Philibert's tomb is quite fittingly the best of the three, as being the simplest
and most dignified. The detail is very Flemish, some of the figures recalling
in pose as well as in costume, the manner of Van Eyck and his school.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>The tomb of Marguerite d'Autriche is beautifully proportioned, but much
of the ornament has so little relation to the design that it appears to be
appliqu&eacute;. Tortured lines are the inevitable result. Many of the figures
however, are very charming; notably the Madeleine holding her hair, and
Catherine of Alexandria trampling down the Emperor Maximilian of Italy.
The Marguerites make effective and appropriate ornament, as also do the
briquets of the house of Burgundy&mdash;two sticks in the form of St. Andrew's
cross.</p>

<p>The altar piece of the virgin in the north transept is one of the most extraordinary
productions of its kind that I know. It is more magnificent even
than the tombs, and far exceeds them in grace, charm, and realism. The
seven scenes represented are: The Ascension of the Virgin; the Visitation;
the Annunciation; the Nativity; the Adoration; Pentecost; Christ appearing
to His Mother. In the oratory of Marguerite d'Autriche there is a curious
oblique arch, enabling her to see both altars at the same time.</p>

<p>Let me close these few notes on the church of Brou with some lively
comments from Paradin's Chronique de Savoie.</p>

<p>"As to the pavement, even that which is in the choir as well as that which
is in the chapel of my said Lady Marguerite d'Autriche, it is in truth a thing
as pleasant and delicious to see as may possibly be found, being all such joyous
and singular leadwork mingled with very divers picturing ... which
so pleases spectators that almost with regret one walks upon it. I remember
that, being there, was a gentleman who feeling scruples at walking on this
pavement, spat in the face of a great rascal of a pastrycook, whose nose was
all beflowered with knobs of scarlet tint, saying that there was no spot in all
the church more dirty to spit on than that."</p>

<p>"I remember also having seen descend (here), the late King Francis<a id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> when
he came to Bourg, who, having seen this church, was ravished with admiration,
saying that he had never seen nor heard of a temple of such excellence
for what it contained. And true it is that he noted (as he was a Prince
exceeding in good sense all the kings of his time) that this white stone of
which the Church is built, would not well endure frost, being too rare and
tender. And it was since found that he spoke truly; for long after there
fell from the clock tower some of the great bastions or gargoyles which take
the water over the roof, on the side of the cloisters, a thing which did much
hurt to the building."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>The revolutionary mob were proposing to do still greater hurt to the
building, and would have done so, had not the wisest man in all Bourg filled
the church with hay which the sans-culottes could not bring themselves to
burn. So Brou is ours, we hope, for many centuries to come.</p>

<p>The first, adopted after her dismissal from the Court of France by Charles VIII.,
was a windswept mountain, with the motto, "Perflant altissimo venti." The
second, taken after the death of John Castille, and her child by him, was a
fruit tree split by lightning.</p>

<p>This enigmatic device has been variously deciphered, but two contemporary authors
agree in interpreting it "<i>Fortuna infortunat fortiter unam</i>," which means
"Fortune tries cruelly a woman." Murray's guide gives incorrectly, "Fortune
infortune forte une," meaning "Here is a woman strong in fortune or in misfortune."</p>

<p>The fabric, however, does not seem to have suffered as much from the quarrels of
the builders, as from the extraordinary failure of the architect to provide
efficiently for carrying away the roof water, with the result that heavy rains
nearly destroyed the building before even it was finished. Loys had probably
forgotten structural soundness in his efforts to satisfy his employer's passion for
decorative effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew Arnold's poem, "The Church of Brou," is marred by a number of unnecessary
inaccuracies. Philibert was not slain by a boar, he died of pleurisy.
Marguerite's Tomb is at the "Crossing East of the Choir," and not in the nave,
moreover, the poet seems so uncertain whether the Church is in the mountain
or in the valley, that one is led to doubt whether he really knew.</p>
